	<h1>Secret Sex Agent Man [Dream Journal Aug 2nd 2013]</h1>
	<div class="post-content">I was up till 9am this morning so my dreams were different and effected by the conversation I had with Selini in the post on this same day. 

<br><br><br>

The furthest back I remember I was a agent infiltrating some building. I had a glock and I was at the T intersection of one long hallway to another. I pressed against the edge of the hallway I was in and peered around the corner and there was a female agent also with a glock (probably the image comes from Olivia Dunham from watching so much Fringe lately). I think we exchanged a few shots when then started talking. I ended up just talking my way past 3 agents or so, all female and sex was implied, but the act never really enacted in my dream (I believe the sleeping past enemies comes from a game, MIM PUT). 

<br><br><br>

Then I think I got to where I was going and the dream changed somehow to where I was in a bed for days. The bed was in that same second hallway towards the end of it where I seemingly reached my destination. It’s size was similar to the bed I was actually sleeping on whilst I dreamt which makes me think at this point I may have been partially awake and aware of my surroundings in real life (aka the bed I was sleeping on). I was on this bed for days and all the while different women were entering and leaving the bed and I was seemingly sleeping with all of them although again the actual act never enacted in the dream, twas only implied. I remember one of them saying that she wished or liked that fact that I was such a huge (although she said huge she was really meaning famous) sex nerd and that was a big reason she was attracted to me but I remember thinking to myself, I’m not a huge famous sex nerd? And that was it.</div>
