	<h1>Back in Los Alamos (again) [Dream Journal Aug 2nd 2013]</h1>
	<div class="post-content">Earliest I recall into the dream I was at my friend Daniel’s from Los Alamos except this time he lived in the island part of Big Rock Loop, about next to where Skip’s house was. I remember walking up a dirt driveway with a small outhouse before the house which the main house was the size of a double trailer (come to think of it, that part of Dan’s home was the same as our upstairs of our home in Tsikumu. We were in the living room area of my house and his and talking about something. Except there was a computer desktop desk against the sun facing wall where we were. It seemed in the dream he was always frowning and in a bad mood and cautious not to break any rules as his whole deminore was via the influence of his strict father. After hanging out like this for a few minutes we then went out to another outhouse in the front yard. From here we didn’t talk much, in fact Dan was outside much closer to the house than I was. I remember looking out from the house towards the neighbors and saw another friend from high school. I don’t recall his name. I remember he was looking sad and it was dark in his house. Not super dark but the lights weren’t on. He did lots of drugs and I had the impression from the dream that his dad wasn’t the nicest to him either. For a second seeing him sparked a thought/desire in my mind wondering when all the guys were going to get together that night and smoke and drink as per usual. Which is interesting to think now that that triggered that desire. 

<br><br><br>

Then Jimmy came over and Sabrina & Sara showed up shortly after. We were not hanging out in the originally described, smaller outhouse. Then Jimmy became a attractive blonde female (actually I don’t ever remember Jimmy being Jimmy in the dream at all), a 8.5 or 9 maybe. I remember thinking to myself that she was always just a really good friend but now after years being away and now that I was visiting again and older (older in my mind), I now suddenly found her attractive. I remember wanting to act on it somehow when all of a sudden there was a ruckus outside. Seems the neighbors, who was no longer the friend from high school from earlier, was upset about something we at Dan’s had done. Something that seemingly affected him but the exact thing was never made clear. So he backed his lawn mower onto the yard and unloaded a block of cut grass the dimensions of a sedan but only a third of the height. I remember I didn’t want to get Dan’s dad angry so I quickly and gracefully acted and began to clean up the grass. 

<br><br><br>

Then the dream changed and I was at my home in New Jersey and I was working on some device. I was using trial and error to try out a bunch of different pieces for whatever I was building. I don’t remember exactly, twas extremely vague. Suddenly Scout, my dog was outside and when I got outside he was walking quickly down the side of the street. He then checked for cars and crossed over. The dream didn’t show him coming back and I didn’t go after him but suddenly he was back in the house and I was in the sun room with him again when he jumped up on the screen dog and pressed the handle open with his nose. He was suddenly off and down the street again crossing. That was all I remember.</div>
