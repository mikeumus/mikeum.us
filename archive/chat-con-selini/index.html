	<div class="post-content"><br><br>

Selini <br>
Yes lets not self medicate the dog to an early death <br>
Yeah i know im just telling u what to look for next time <br>
Nice blog btw <br>
I think im deactivating my fb tomorrow <br>
Today <br>
Its a depressing source of nothingness anymore <br>
Aside from u i dont hear from anyone

<br><br>

5:45am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
umm <br>
lol <br>
that's how the internet actually is no one really cares about anyone

<br><br>

5:46am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
even hot girls, there's like a lot of them now online so even your bread is desensatized

<br><br>

5:46am <br>
Selini <br>
This is sad but true <br>

<br><br>

5:46am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
yeah <br>
it's touch on the net now <br>
tough* 

<br><br>

5:46am <br>
Selini <br>
Who are you telling?! <br>

<br><br>

5:47am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
and probably going to get worse 

<br><br>

5:47am <br>
Selini <br>
We are all fuvked

<br><br>

5:47am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
lol

<br><br>

5:47am <br>
Selini <br>
And fucking ourselves <br>
With porn etc. <br>
Ppl want and expect a virtual sense of reality <br>

<br><br>

5:48am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
yeah <br>
porn is a horrible sex <strong>educator</strong> lol 

<br><br>

5:48am
Selini
And in real life it can't be that way <br>
The FUCKING worst <br>
Its the beginning of the end for. All future marriages  generations are literally and figuratively screwed <br>
This should be your next blog <br> 
I need it to be 7 so I can get up and swim laps <br>

<br><br>

5:51am
Michael Duane Mooring
lol I actually did plan to blog about sex nerd stuff

<br><br>

5:51am <br>
Selini <br>
Mierda <br>

<br><br>

5:52am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
there is a really good podcast, <a target="_blank" href="http://sexnerdsandra.com/">Sex Nerd Sandra</a> <br>
and the <a target="_blank" href="http://pickuppodcast.com/">Pickup Podcast</a>, which the host Jordan is much more respectable along with his company than the title would imply.

<br><br>

5:53am <br>
Selini <br>
I would blog about the porn age and how its taking society backwards rather then forward. Porn age= stone age

<br><br>

5:53am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
in my opinion, people wanting sex to be like they see in a porn, really aren't being in enough relationships to know that that's not real at all <br>
casue girls aren't like that <br>
lol <br>
and there needs to be so much communication <br>
you can't just run in there like it's a football game <br>
even in a football game you talk about the plan before hand, lol

<br><br>

5:54am <br>
Selini <br>
Well yes. But after enough desensitization to the male brain the ave female doesn't suffice any more.

<br><br>

5:55am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
maybe I'll just post this as a lazy blog post if you don't mind. I can have you anonymous if you'd like.

<br><br>

5:55am <br>
Selini <br>
And that's were we fail <br>
Sure do it up 

<br><br>

5:56am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
lol, I don't think it's doom and gloom like your feeling. I think it's a matter of <strong>education</strong>. I always have hope for humanity. Personally, I feel like me being this wise hermit that's not currently active sexually or relationship-wise creates a imbalance in nature and damages it somehow, lol.

<br><br>

5:57am
Selini<br>
Haha no I think more ppl need to be like you<br>
And wait for the right one<br>

<br><br>

5:57am<br>
Michael Duane Mooring<br>
yeah, till I'm 40, lol<br>

<br><br>

5:58am
Selini<br>
Physical attractions fade when in a committed relationship<br>
Hahahahaha<br>
No no not that long 

<br><br>

5:59am<br>
Selini<br>
I mean people should date b4 they procreate<br>
Go back to the basics

<br><br>

6:00am
Michael Duane Mooring<br>
yeah  I agree. There are more and more 'open-relationships' now too.

<br><br>

6:02am
Michael Duane Mooring<br>
there was a Pickup Podcast with a interview on open rela's but I'm not a fan and truthfully I'm not a fan of homosexuality either, again with the imbalance feeling/philosophy. If that one study showed that it's a actual growth on their brain, then that's like, a medical issue, not a sexual preference. And the one Dr.Oz episode with the gay guys that didn't want to be gay anymore, or feel gay.

<br><br>

6:04am<br>
Selini<br>
Yeah I think a lot of it is choice and some chemical imbalances<br></div>
