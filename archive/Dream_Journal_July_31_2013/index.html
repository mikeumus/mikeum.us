	<h1>Dream Journal July 31th 2013</h1>
	<div class="post-content">The dream segment I remember from last night involved me being back in high school in a table/desk in a classroom after school with 4 or 5 other people around the table working on homework/studying. A teacher was there helping us. At some point, not sure if it was at this point or later but Caroline from Chairlift became the teacher with bright blonde but seemingly natural with 3 inches or so towards the end, ending in her natural brown hair color. I remember specifically how vivid and natural her hair looked and a very clean/clear parting of her hair in the back (If you can't tell by now, #fyi I have a huge crush on Caroline). We worked there for a while and I remember thinking how nice it was for the teacher to stay after school and help me. 

<br><br><br>

After we all piled in a car and drove to a friend’s house with the teacher as the driver. We got there and first hung out up stairs for a while playing a computer game I was for a few minutes I believe with one of the kids that lived there. They had a big family, probably 5 kids, cats and dogs and the house was a little messy but not the worst. Then we went down stairs where they had a pool and a walk out basement (this was very similar in dimension to our old house in Los Alamos actually where my dad build our house with a similar walk out basement). I remember my cousin Andre was there and dived in the pool head first. I remember following after him trying to dive head first with my hands in front of me, but it didn't work and I more so belly flopped (I've never dove head first into water before in my life I don't think and I remember vaguely being at a pool after having too much to drink, diving off the diving board and flopping similarly). 

<br><br><br>

After my attempted dive I wasn't that far into the water but I put my feet against the edge of the pool and pushed deeper down. Then my feet were on the bottom and I continued to push around. Andre was swimming around underwater too. Then I got out and walked around the edge of the pool for a little. There was a row of desks and computers against the walk out face and again I went to watch one of the kids play a game. When I was down I looked back and the pool was empty. They had left me there. I remember feeling awkward at their home being left there and slightly let down and degraded. I believe I began walking home and then called my mom and let her know what had happened. And for some reason in the call I explained to her that part of the reason I had no ride back was because Gabe and I bought a fish. 

I do remember asking one character in my dream about something and he gave a definite answer. I always have a sub-awareness that I’m in a dream when I am and I believe I remember even asking him, if he was sure and he was. His answer felt external. He had a handlebar mustache. I remember receiving one other definite answer in the dream but I think it was of something of no consequence and may have had to do with fish or something similar again.</div>
