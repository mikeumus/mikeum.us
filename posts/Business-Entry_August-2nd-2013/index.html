	<h1>The Captain's Log - &quot;Hobby-like&quot; [Business Entry August 2nd 2013]</h1>
	<div class="post-content">It's 4:40am. Up too late again but I had this revelation whilst in the rest room before bed abour keeping a business diary. I have a feeling I've thought this idea up at least once before but years ago and now that I'm keeping my dream journal I figured to add a business one. 

<br><br><br>

Early to bed, early to rise make a man healthy, weathly and wise. That's not been my pattern of late. I've been up till 3am and sleep till 11 or 12noon. It's not the most adventagious schedule and I beleive there is smoething to seeing the sun rise in the morning that is very boosting in a direct health way of sorts I hypothesize. So this un-worthy sleep cycle is needing to be replaced. My plan tonight (or this morning) is to wake up in a couple hours and power through the day just taking a few breaks every 15 minutes or so to scretch, work on some chores ect... and then retire at 10pm. 

<br><br><br>

I re-fathomed recently that in any given day I'm awake 16 hours. Which in theory could give 12 hours to work and 4 to misc things. However it never really works out as planned. In fact for me plans have never ever worked. I blame myself and my dicipline, but because of my unsuccessful career of planning I now avoid them and have been opperating sometime without a written one. I need one. I need to spend time working out and meditating on my plan. I need my plan to be my mantra. I already have my vision in tact and it's been waiting for years now as I toil hobby-like trying to skip stones to the other side of the lake. 

<br><br><br>

Now about today. I spent about 6 hours or so (4 more hours than allotted) on my one of two client projects as I was working and re-working it to add a list of new specialty features that nor I or the client have insisted upon. I always do this. I turn each project from a business project, into a hobby-like one. Sure I always learn new things but it makes the project late and in-turn, very much not profitable working well below minimum wage surely all expenses aside. At least in this case the client understands mostly and in concerned that the project is profitable for me and doesn't want me to spend more hours than need be. This is litterally a first. I think it's a sign. The voice of God litterally coming through my client's mouth. Wrap that website up McDonald's style and get it out the door Mike! Your 24, this is and can no longer be a hooby business. A business that actually costs you money to opperate. Truely qualifies as a hobby and I'm not repeating the word hobby over and over again because it's been preached to me by a parent or relative becuase it really hasn't, I'm saying it because of it's features, namely the lack of profitability.  

<br><br><br>

It's time to suit up. (I wonder if there is a proper/effective way to journal with intension like my intension is now with this first entry of my personal business journal). I think I'll call these, The Captain's Log, moving forward. Actually I'm going to change it now.  :)</div>
