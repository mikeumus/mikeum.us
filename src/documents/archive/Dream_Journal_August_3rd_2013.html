This time I wasn't back in high school in my dream and I was back on the East Coast, not Los Alamos. Unfortunately I didn't log this right when I got out of bed but the farthest back I do remember is still significant. I was driving into NYC to some specific location for a meeting or event of sorts. It felt like it could have been business in nature. I remember getting lost and driving through some neighborhoods that were semi-sketchy but not too bad. I considered pulling over and figuring out where to go but didn't. I seemingly wasn't using a GPS. I remember leaving the neighborhood and getting back ore on a highway-like road. I remember driving through an overlapping intersection and feeling like I missed the correct forked exit. 

<br><br><br>

I finally got to where I was going, some building that was closed/locked but I had a way prepared/known way in. Once inside I met up with a girl. Seems the event was actually a rendezvous with this girl. We were walking down the hallway of an office-like building, plain with carpeted floors. We got to the end of the hallway and a door on the left where we knew was locked and had a shipment of some sort of goods that we worked with together in our day-job (the context/feeling was that we didn't normally work in this building during out day job though). Suddenly we could hear someone coming. They were with someone or talking on the phone to someone. 

<br><br><br>

She got excited and used the opportunity to ploy me into picking the lock (picking the lock may have come from seeing all the lock picking in Fringe) to sneak into the storage room, which really wasn't much of a storage room more so than an empty office with a few boxes cardboard inside. I remember we opened one of the boxes with my Swiss army knife but the contents where never shown or used in the dream. After almost 30 minutes or so of just sitting on the floor talking, doing nothing, we were not talking and it was time to do something. We had obviously met here secretly for a reason and it was time to make a move. 

<br><br><br>

I was really shy about it as expected and didn't know how to gracefully initiate. So instead I just imagined in my mind what to do, but I was in a dream so that thinking in my mind manifested into the actual dream and suddenly we were naked and in the act. I don't remember all the details but I remember it was passionate and in the moment. We experimented with different things and had a good time. I won't describe the details as to remain PG but the reason this is significant as stated above it because sexual acts are 99.99999999% never actually enacted in my dreams. I always attributed this to the fact that there is sparse sexual activity in my real life and therefore nothing to go off of but if my mind brings events from Fringe, which I've been watching nightly, then why would it enact sex as I do watch porn every now and then (not for the duration that I watch Fringe but watched regardless). 

<br><br><br>

And so now I hypothesize that this sexual enactment is the result of me journaling that it wasn't enacted just the previous dream entry and this stimulated or sponsored it occurring last night. This could be very significant indeed and in that case I still need to remember more of my dream scenes and to be much more lucid in my dreams. Request away to the back of my brain and to the cosmos! My answers await.
