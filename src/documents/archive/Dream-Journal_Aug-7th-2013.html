This dream is pretty random but here's what I remember. The farthest back I remember I was walking through the second floor of a building with a revolver on a mission of sorts. I remember being with two others on my team, a guy and a girl (which I think may have even been Agent Dunham and Lee from Fringe, not exactly them, but versions of them). But then it was just me wondering around a hallway with all the lights on. No one else was there on the floor. I went back downstairs which was a co-ed locker room of a gym seemingly. The lockers were blue and the grown was grey as it was just concrete. I went to a locker to change my clothes. There was a woman attending her locker a few rows down. She wasn't particularly attractive, a 5 or 6, but I remember thinking to myself, "I should be polite and start a conversation". I believe she initiated a conversation and we had a friendly banter for a few minutes before leaving. I believe I met him before I got outside but there was a guy, maybe a couple years older than me, I didn't have a ride home so he offered to give me a lift.

We talked about a bunch of stuff but I don't recall details except for when we were outside at his truck I told him I was from New Mexico. Los Alamos, NM I remember saying it from a position of ego as Los Alamos is very much not a average place to be from. He didn't know where that was and so I fell back how I always do in that situation and explained it's where Los Alamos National Laboratory  is (no one usually knows what LANL is either so in the same line I have to include), where they built the atomic bomb. He didn't reply, didn't seem to care and was already thinking about something else. Suddenly he went from being just a friendly guy to exhibiting attraction towards me. I remember feeling unfortune and now having to deal with the change of events. We talked a little bit more outside and then went back inside to order a meal as the ground floor had now become a diner. I remember us going up to be seated and then suddenly I was but just me. The waiter came and I asked what happened to the person I walked in with and he explained how I had slipped away from him and sat myself here suddenly when he wasn't looking. I remember having scrambled eggs (eggs is what Walter and Olivia had last night in a episode of Fringe (I've been watching entirely too much Fringe)). Then I left and called my dad to give me a ride. He was asking why I didn't get a ride home and I told him I couldn't find one but he showed up in his truck and we left. That was all I remember of last night.
