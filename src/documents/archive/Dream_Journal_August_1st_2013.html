The farthest back I can remember of my dream last night I was on the steep sheet metal roof of a barn in New Mexico somewhere with about 13 other co-workders. It was late afternoon and seems like we all got together there after work as some of us were still in our business casual attire. We were smoking weed and drinking beers. When then drove around and parked outside of a neightborhood. Someone may have gone into one of their homes there and got something. We then we to a little cul-de-sac where a high school friend, Shawn C. lived. We went to the front door and rang the door bell. Shawn answered and when we opened the door there was a small tunnel like a metal drainage tunnel exatly similar metal to the one in the arroyo behind the Bob & Alice Palace that Gabe and I traversed many many times in our youth. But this tunnel in my dream wasn't nearly as long. Twas only 7 or 9 feet long and led to Shawn's room. Where there were only 4 or so of us. Two guys and two girls. Ohh and at some point before or after going to Shawn's we went by the palace and Alice came with us so Alice was sitting there on the floor with us as we hung out and continued to drink and smoke. I remember her finding some of what we were doing/saying rude and tasteless but I explained to her there this was the custom. That's all I rmemeber of the dream.

I wish I could remember further back in my dreams. I think one key to this is writing these entried right out of bed.
