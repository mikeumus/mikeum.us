The part that I do remember from this night's dream we were leaving the Bob & Alice Palace in Big Rock Loop. Twas me and three other friends. They were childhood friends but their exactly identity was variable and delta. Outside of the house were three or so drag racing cars. We got in and blasted off headed uptown. The vehicles were very fast. Fast like we were going 60 and then could be going 80-90 in a second literally to catch up with out fellow drag racers. There were many square sections of pavement cut out of road, maybe about 3 or 4 on the way out of Big Rock Loop with construction crews of 3 or 2 people at some of them with orange protective helmets and tee shirts. I remember being concerned with hitting the sharp bumps resulting from the cut pavement going so fast but the car seemed to do fine over them. We sped uptown and ended up a Sonic. Although this Sonic was on the side of the soccer field where Matt B's house should have been.
