The first dream I remember from last night woke me from my sleep. Someone was explaining something to me in my dream and right when they said "...and it happens on the number 13." I shot out of bed thinking it was 6:09am when I did which in my half asleep state I thought was related to 13 somehow and it freaked me out a little. One of my arms were completely numb when I popped out so that didn't help either. I used the rest room with my limp arm, getting it to wake up and then I went back to sleep.

Now the earliest back in this next dream scene I remember (although I do remember it starting earlier), was walking into an old bowling alley type business on Main Street of a random an ol' town New Mexico style place. It was some type of bowling but not exactly. I was at the front desk which curved around in a long "U" shape where the two ends of the "U" met the wall of the facade of the building. An old white man with grey hair, maybe 80 or so was at the counter. There was some sort or verification/approval/paper process to allow us to enter the building and play the game that took a little time. After a few minutes three other guys joined the line native New Mexicans or the punk rocker type, all white and seemingly around my age. At first they didn't interact much but as we were approved and headed back to what was going to be like the locker room, we passed through some of the strangest architecture. Not like an alien style or anything, everything was still of the style of the old building just we walked through the strangest shaped doors and openings. Finally a very narrow opening. All the while each carrying a large bag of clothes (it was just him and I now, the dream rid his two friends). Through the narrow passage and down some equally small stairs we went into what looked like a furnished on room apartment. Of course everything was of the old/used style so the TV was a tube/analog one. It was on the basement level and there were small windows near the ceiling and where level with the sidewalk outside. I mentioned to him, man this place is trippy and he replied, I am tripping (like literally he was on drugs but he also thought the place was trippy). I turned to a darker cutout in the wall to put my stuff down. There were no lights on, just the light from the sidewalk windows but it was mid-day so everything was moderately lit. T dropped my bag in the dark cut out and like the Cheshire cat, Kristina was sitting in the cut out smiling with her hands on the floor by her sides leaning forward slightly. We exchanged some words, I don't know what exactly and then the scene changed.   

<br><br><br>

I was back outside progressing further down the main street from the direction I had originated. I came to the end of Main Street where a empty dirt lot and a big tree grew. The kind that grow big and tall along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque with the small green leaves. Suddenly I came across the trio together there sitting in the sunny street, Katrina, Kristina and Kara. Completely chillaxed, enjoying the easy weather/breeze and the sun. We said 'hi' and exchanged words but I don't recall exactly. I remember saying something like "oh it's you guys again, how nice." in a teasing/sarcastic way. I then went to lay in the opposite corner of the street, diagonally away from them as well, limbs fully stretched out and in the full sun (whereas they were in the full shade of the tree in the lot). I just laid there, trying to be even more chillax then they were while ignoring them a little. Of course they didn't care. Dylan H walked up on my side of the street and we exchanged some words that I forget. Scene change. 

<br><br><br>

We were now fully down that street that was Main Street and it curved to the left and turned into houses instead of buildings along the street. I to one of the houses just where the curve ended. There were some college female students outside. I forget all the details, but it felt almost like a sorority but it wasn't, it was just someone's house that went to UNM and had some friends over. I guess what made it feel like a sorority or some official part of the college was there was a small fold-out table on the porch of the house where they were talking to people about something and then a mid-aged nurse showed up too for the college students to give some of shots. Then again Kristina, Kara and Katrina rolled up and got out. The nurse was making sure everyone had their shots and Kristina was dreading it because she knew she hadn't had hers yet. She said she hated doctor visits in a spaced out/distracted manner. She said she didn't want to get the shot but that chocolate always made it better. "So let's have some chocolate then I said". She got excited and said "Okay, I'll go get some". She came back with a chocolate cake and we used forks and ate right from the cake. Her actually getting the shot never enacted although the nurse was silently to the side of us watching and waiting, not creepily but just subtly there, almost not, as a dream figure. 

<br><br><br>

We were eating the cake on a round wooden picnic table and many of our friends were with us at/around the table now too. Kristina was sitting on the table, I on its bench. We were talking and I remember me saying something worried and Kristina responded something like, "but that's why you have me" with a comforting/warm smile. I grabbed her arm just above elbow and leaned my head in a hug from the positioning of her on sitting upright on the table it made the hug positioned awkwardly like that but it didn't matter at that moment, the message was received. I remember thinking, "maybe this time it's alright. Maybe this time I can just be here in this comfortable/safe/loving environment and everything was going to be okay." The dream ended and I awoke to cold, early reality, two thousand miles away. How did I get here?
