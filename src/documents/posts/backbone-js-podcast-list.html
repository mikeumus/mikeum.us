    I've been researhing and am starting to learn about backbone.js, which may seem kind of backwards with react and angular taking over and ember.js and things but my new gig uses backbone.js so I've been checking it out and it's philosophy is quite interesting.

<p>
    It's all about helping organize and evolve your javascript/front-end code but is most minimal in mandating anything. It's designed to be super light-weight and for you to build atop. Common use-case is to organize your jQuery code.
