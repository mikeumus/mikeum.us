The earliest back in my dreams last night I remember a zombie scene back in Los Alamos. I was with Zach M and we found a empty house that resembled mine in Tsikamo. We entered and began scavaging for things when K her sister and mom came home. We were glad to see them and re-grouped a little. Shortly after that K's dad came home. I don't remember him saying hi but Zach had begun taking apart the flat screen tv in the master bedroom and he pointed that out to us in a stern way. Before he could tell us what to do Zach had it back together. 

<br><br>

I went outside and remember looking around at the mountains and feeling the warm breeze thinking that this zombie thing really made for a peaceful world. K came out shortly after. We talked for a little and then an encouter occured but was short lived. More of just a kind gesture on her behalf. Feeling pitty I assume. Or at least it ended with those ideas but that's not how it started. That's all I recall of the zombie scene. 

<br><br>

Actaully I'm probably missing a transition here but next I recall being on a school bus headed for high-school. I was a few seats behind the middle of the bus on the left side and K and Matt S were a few seats ahead of me on the left side. K was more friendly and into Matt than he was. She was being her normal bubbly awesome self.

It was the first day of senior year. I skated around the school, not knowing where any of my classes were (this is a incident that happened in real life, both the skateboarding through school(a couple times), and the first day without getting my class papers till the bell rang although the two events on different occations). The first bell rang and I finally found a faculty office facade counter where students were lined up to get their class schedules and locker numbers ect... Shawn C was in line behind me. Was good to see him again. I got my class papers and my first class was called illuminati. I didn't pick the class and I remember wondering how it got there. I wondered the hall ways clueless and came across a classroom who's facade was elaborate greek and cathedral-like design. The room had no number and had a couple doors into it. I figured this matched the style for a class like this so I entered a door that was already slightly open. There was a large projector screen. The room coud have almost been two stories. The walls all held books like a library and everything was custom and ornate except the tile floor and desks. I walked straight in, not looking at anyone and found a desk to the right of the room which was the closest path to a desk from the door I enetered. The desks were all in a semi-circle around the projector and teacher. The teacher addressed me asking if I like being late and I settled still with my skateboard in my hands. I said "Well Ye... No". I started to answer yes but the room was stern, no room for class clowns in this sanctuary of learning. 

<br><br>

We were learning the historical events on video. Then K and Matt were there in a desk in front of me suddenly. K was answering the teach with a story about a little boy she was looking over at work. "...and the boy just wouldn't kiss me" as she sighed and leaned he her on Matt's chest. She said this as if this little boy not giving her a kiss on the cheek was improbable, but saying it in a manner that she was not obviously actually distressed, but more so playfully distressed. "... and then I finished the story and he gave me a kiss finally" not those exact words, but something similar. 

<br><br>

It's been 7 years with K as a consistent dream character and in last night's dream she was in every scene. Quite persistent. What is this about? My conscience sentimental feelings for her other than caring for her like a sister are all but gone. I rarely think of her now and never even frequently in the past that I recall. Maybe it's from watching Ghost in the Shell and the character the Major, how she's always confident in herself and independent, noble, rightious, humorous/joking and of course physically attractive. But could that alone arise such a dream? Why didn't I just dream of the Major then? How deep is this in my subconscience and why?

To be a human, alas.
