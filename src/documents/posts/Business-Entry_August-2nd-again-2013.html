It's still Aug 2nd! So Base (<a target="_blank" href="https://getbase.com/">GetBase.com</a>) is pretty nifty. On my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/"data-placement="below" rel="tipsy" data-content="So Nokia is being featured with a 41 megapixel phone on WindowsPhone.com, bad ass.">Windows Phone</a> I always feel so helpless business wise because I had no app to see metrics and push buttons that actually did stuff until I revisited Base today and found it has a app for Windows Phone that I can see where sales are at. You can pin different tiles to your home and my favorite is the pipeline total. How motivating is that to see a huge dollar amount waiting for you on your phone's home screen? It makes me feel like, "Okay, what's next? Let's push it forward!"

Oh and I don't know if you've ever received a lead from Twitter but, seems like Twitter is a friendly, less competitive route to go from my experience. Which reminds me, I wonder is there is a Hootsuite app for Windows Phone?...

There wasn't, but I would have bet against there being one. The Windows Phone app market is a wary place for many of big app holders to invest in seems. <a target="_blank" href="https://voxer.com/" data-placement="below" rel="tipsy" data-content="An app that turns your phone into a walkie-talkie, nifty I tell you.">Voxer</a> is a Windows Phone app now though so, Yay for Voxer!
