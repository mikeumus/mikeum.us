It's still Aug 2nd! So Base (getbase.com) is pretty nifty. On my Windows Phone I always feel so helpless business wise because I had no app to see metrics and push buttons that actually did stuff until I revisited Base today and found it has a app for Windows Phone that I can see where sales are at. You can pin different tiles to your home and my favorite is the pipline total. How motivating is that to see a huge dollar ammount waiting for you on your phone's homescreen? It makes me feel like, "Okay, what's next? Let's push it forward!"

Oh and I don't know if you've ever received a lead from Twitter but, seems like Twitter is a friendly, less competitive route to go from my experience. Which reminds me, I wonder is there is a Hootsuite app for Windows Phone?...

There wasn't, but I would have bet against there being one. The Windows Phone app market is a wary place for many of big app holders to invest in seems. Voxer is here now though. Yay for Voxer!
