5:47am <br>
Selini <br>
And fucking ourselves <br>
With porn etc. <br>
Ppl want and expect a virtual sense of reality <br>

<br><br>

5:48am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
yeah <br>
porn is a horrible sex educator lol 

<br><br>

5:48am
Selini
And in real life it can't be that way
The FUCKING worst
Its the beginning of the end for. All future marriages  generations are literally and figuratively screwed
This should be your next blog
I need it to be 7 so I can get up and swim laps

<br><br>

5:51am
Michael Duane Mooring
lol I actually did plan to blog about sex nerd stuff

<br><br>

5:51am <br>
Selini <br>
Mierda <br>

<br><br>

5:52am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
there is a really good podcast, Sex Nerd Sandra <br>
and the Pickup Podcast, which the host Jordan is much more respectable along with his company than the title would imply.

<br><br>

5:53am <br>
Selini <br>
I would blog about the porn age and how its taking society backwards rather then forward. Porn age= stone age

<br><br>

5:53am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
in my opinion, people wanting sex to be like they see in a porn, really aren't being in enough relationships to know that that's not real at all <br>
casue girls aren't like that <br>
lol <br>
and there needs to be so much communication <br>
you can't just run in there like it's a football game <br>
even in a football game you talk about the plan before hand, lol

<br><br>

5:54am <br>
Selini <br>
Well yes. But after enough desensitization to the male brain the ave female doesn't suffice any more.

<br><br>

5:55am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
maybe I'll just post this as a lazy blog post if you don't mind. I can have you anonymous if you'd like.

<br><br>

5:55am <br>
Selini <br>
And that's were we fail <br>
Sure do it up 

<br><br>

5:56am <br>
Michael Duane Mooring <br>
lol, I don't think it's doom and gloom like your feeling. I think it's a matter of education. I always have hope for humanity. Personally, I feel like me being this wise hermit that's not currently active sexually or relationship-wise creates a imbalance in nature and damages it somehow, lol.

<br><br>

5:57am
Selini<br>
Haha no I think more ppl need to be like you<br>
And wait for the right one<br>

<br><br>

5:57am<br>
Michael Duane Mooring<br>
yeah, till I'm 40, lol<br>

<br><br>

5:58am
Selini<br>
Physical attractions fade when in a committed relationship<br>
Hahahahaha<br>
No no not that long 

<br><br>

5:59am<br>
Selini<br>
I mean people should date b4 they procreate<br>
Go back to the basics

<br><br>

6:00am
Michael Duane Mooring<br>
yeah  I agree. There are more and more 'open-relationships' now too.

<br><br>

6:02am
Michael Duane Mooring<br>
there was a Pickup Podcast with a interview on open rela's but I'm not a fan and truthfully I'm not a fan of homosexuality either, again with the imbalance feeling/philosophy. If that one study showed that it's a actual growth on their brain, then that's like, a medical issue, not a sexual preference. And the one Dr.Oz episode with the gay guys that didn't want to be gay anymore, or feel gay.

<br><br>

6:04am<br>
Selini<br>
Yeah I think a lot of it is choice and some chemical imbalances<br>
