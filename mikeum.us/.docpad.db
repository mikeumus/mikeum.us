Code is still computer science in college course titles, no one thought to change it to computational blocks yet. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nYes frameworks, the amount of people coding and superset languages have made things easier to get a prototype online, but it's still code. They are still “languages” and there are multiple languages used in getting your idea online. If you were a contractor, already experienced and building houses and someone came to you and said to you “Hey I’ve got this great property by the ocean. You build a house there for me and when it sells, I’ll give you 10%!” Sounds… bad.\n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nAnd this is how it sounds when your looking for a developer for your startup: &lt;strong&gt;“Hey I’ve got this great app idea. You code it for me and I’ll give you 10%.”&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe, if it ever turns into anything, but you're up against 9/10 odds for your business' success. The point is, when you break it down to that simple form, it’s weak. It’s a bad deal on the developer’s side. Sure there are more developers now than ever but there are still not enough. This is why Mark Zuckerberg has teamed with Bill Gates and others to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;, because they (Mark &amp;amp; Bill) don’t have enough coders for their own growing businesses (Facebook &amp;amp; Microsoft) in a growing industry. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nThere are countless IT recruitment businesses. I can’t believe so many are in business it’s boggling to me. They are aggressive. They find talent and have them in their client’s office in a week or two and these jobs pay really well. If you want to find a quality developer off the streets to sit at your house and code for you, you're facing some steep competition and money.\n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nBack in the 90s, to have your own business was a very serious thing. The stigma back then was that you needed to go in with a hundred thousand or two and have all your ducks in a nice need row before you had any chance of maybe succeeding. Now the stigma has and is changing in our ever technologically advancing world towards anyone with an app idea feeling entitled to have that chance at becoming a iApp millionaire. Hopefully, younger developers and entrepreneurs won’t look back on this article in the near future (next 3 years maybe), when developing software for machines &amp;amp; devices is literally as simple/intuitive as stacking lego blocks and think that I was just a bitter old man, mouthing off in his own little blog post. I hope instead it reflects how I’m feeling in the present, just before lego block coding but facing an oncoming sea of startup ideas and the stigma that each is great and deserves a developer to code their idea. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nI hope this article wasn’t too harsh. The good news we have a system in place here at BetaBulls to get your app idea online. We are lucky enough to already have a sturdy team of developers to bring your idea to life. We’re an idea factory. We make apps all day. If you're set on finding a lone developer for your startup, then please, don’t be discouraged by my writing above. They are out there and there are more and more everyday, but if you look and look and look and simply can’t find, remember that we’ll still be here waiting and ready to upstart your awesome app idea. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Sincerely&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://mikeum.us/&quot;&gt;Michael Duane Mooring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

lol \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:48am\nSelini\nAnd in real life it can't be that way &lt;br&gt;\nThe FUCKING worst &lt;br&gt;\nIts the beginning of the end for. All future marriages  generations are literally and figuratively screwed &lt;br&gt;\nThis should be your next blog &lt;br&gt; \nI need it to be 7 so I can get up and swim laps &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:51am\nMichael Duane Mooring\nlol I actually did plan to blog about sex nerd stuff\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:51am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nMierda &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:52am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nthere is a really good podcast, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://sexnerdsandra.com/&quot;&gt;Sex Nerd Sandra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nand the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://pickuppodcast.com/&quot;&gt;Pickup Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which the host Jordan is much more respectable along with his company than the title would imply.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:53am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nI would blog about the porn age and how its taking society backwards rather then forward. Porn age= stone age\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:53am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nin my opinion, people wanting sex to be like they see in a porn, really aren't being in enough relationships to know that that's not real at all &lt;br&gt;\ncasue girls aren't like that &lt;br&gt;\nlol &lt;br&gt;\nand there needs to be so much communication &lt;br&gt;\nyou can't just run in there like it's a football game &lt;br&gt;\neven in a football game you talk about the plan before hand, lol\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:54am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nWell yes. But after enough desensitization to the male brain the ave female doesn't suffice any more.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:55am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nmaybe I'll just post this as a lazy blog post if you don't mind. I can have you anonymous if you'd like.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:55am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nAnd that's were we fail &lt;br&gt;\nSure do it up \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:56am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nlol, I don't think it's doom and gloom like your feeling. I think it's a matter of &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt;. I always have hope for humanity. Personally, I feel like me being this wise hermit that's not currently active sexually or relationship-wise creates a imbalance in nature and damages it somehow, lol.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:57am\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nHaha no I think more ppl need to be like you&lt;br&gt;\nAnd wait for the right one&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:57am&lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring&lt;br&gt;\nyeah, till I'm 40, lol&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:58am\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nPhysical attractions fade when in a committed relationship&lt;br&gt;\nHahahahaha&lt;br&gt;\nNo no not that long \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:59am&lt;br&gt;\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nI mean people should date b4 they procreate&lt;br&gt;\nGo back to the basics\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n6:00am\nMichael Duane Mooring&lt;br&gt;\nyeah  I agree. There are more and more 'open-relationships' now too.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n6:02am\nMichael Duane Mooring&lt;br&gt;\nthere was a Pickup Podcast with a interview on open rela's but I'm not a fan and truthfully I'm not a fan of homosexuality either, again with the imbalance feeling/philosophy. If that one study showed that it's a actual growth on their brain, then that's like, a medical issue, not a sexual preference. And the one Dr.Oz episode with the gay guys that didn't want to be gay anymore, or feel gay.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n6:04am&lt;br&gt;\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nYeah I think a lot of it is choice and some chemical imbalances&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;Dream Journal July 31th 2013&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The dream segment I remember from last night involved me being back in high school in a table/desk in a classroom after school with 4 or 5 other people around the table working on homework/studying. A teacher was there helping us. At some point, not sure if it was at this point or later but Caroline from Chairlift became the teacher with bright blonde but seemingly natural with 3 inches or so towards the end, ending in her natural brown hair color. I remember specifically how vivid and natural her hair looked and a very clean/clear parting of her hair in the back (If you can't tell by now, #fyi I have a huge crush on Caroline). We worked there for a while and I remember thinking how nice it was for the teacher to stay after school and help me. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAfter we all piled in a car and drove to a friend’s house with the teacher as the driver. We got there and first hung out up stairs for a while playing a computer game I was for a few minutes I believe with one of the kids that lived there. They had a big family, probably 5 kids, cats and dogs and the house was a little messy but not the worst. Then we went down stairs where they had a pool and a walk out basement (this was very similar in dimension to our old house in Los Alamos actually where my dad build our house with a similar walk out basement). I remember my cousin Andre was there and dived in the pool head first. I remember following after him trying to dive head first with my hands in front of me, but it didn't work and I more so belly flopped (I've never dove head first into water before in my life I don't think and I remember vaguely being at a pool after having too much to drink, diving off the diving board and flopping similarly). \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAfter my attempted dive I wasn't that far into the water but I put my feet against the edge of the pool and pushed deeper down. Then my feet were on the bottom and I continued to push around. Andre was swimming around underwater too. Then I got out and walked around the edge of the pool for a little. There was a row of desks and computers against the walk out face and again I went to watch one of the kids play a game. When I was down I looked back and the pool was empty. They had left me there. I remember feeling awkward at their home being left there and slightly let down and degraded. I believe I began walking home and then called my mom and let her know what had happened. And for some reason in the call I explained to her that part of the reason I had no ride back was because Gabe and I bought a fish. \n\nI do remember asking one character in my dream about something and he gave a definite answer. I always have a sub-awareness that I’m in a dream when I am and I believe I remember even asking him, if he was sure and he was. His answer felt external. He had a handlebar mustache. I remember receiving one other definite answer in the dream but I think it was of something of no consequence and may have had to do with fish or something similar again.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

Alice Palace in Big Rock Loop. Twas me and three other friends. They were childhood friends but their exactly identity was variable and delta. Outside of the house were three or so drag racing cars. We got in and blasted off headed uptown. The vehicles were very fast. Fast like we were going 60 and then could be going 80-90 in a second literally to catch up with out fellow drag racers. There were many square sections of pavement cut out of road, maybe about 3 or 4 on the way out of Big Rock Loop with construction crews of 3 or 2 people at some of them with orange protective helmets and tee shirts. I remember being concerned with hitting the sharp bumps resulting from the cut pavement going so fast but the car seemed to do fine over them. We sped uptown and ended up a Sonic. Although this Sonic was on the side of the soccer field where Matt B's house should have been.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

[Dream Journal Aug 3rd 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;This time I wasn't back in high school in my dream and I was back on the East Coast, not Los Alamos. Unfortunately I didn't log this right when I got out of bed but the farthest back I do remember is still significant. I was driving into NYC to some specific location for a meeting or event of sorts. It felt like it could have been business in nature. I remember getting lost and driving through some neighborhoods that were semi-sketchy but not too bad. I considered pulling over and figuring out where to go but didn't. I seemingly wasn't using a GPS. I remember leaving the neighborhood and getting back ore on a highway-like road. I remember driving through an overlapping intersection and feeling like I missed the correct forked exit. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI finally got to where I was going, some building that was closed/locked but I had a way prepared/known way in. Once inside I met up with a girl. Seems the event was actually a rendezvous with this girl. We were walking down the hallway of an office-like building, plain with carpeted floors. We got to the end of the hallway and a door on the left where we knew was locked and had a shipment of some sort of goods that we worked with together in our day-job (the context/feeling was that we didn't normally work in this building during out day job though). Suddenly we could hear someone coming. They were with someone or talking on the phone to someone. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nShe got excited and used the opportunity to ploy me into picking the lock (picking the lock may have come from seeing all the lock picking in Fringe) to sneak into the storage room, which really wasn't much of a storage room more so than an empty office with a few boxes cardboard inside. I remember we opened one of the boxes with my Swiss army knife but the contents where never shown or used in the dream. After almost 30 minutes or so of just sitting on the floor talking, doing nothing, we were not talking and it was time to do something. We had obviously met here secretly for a reason and it was time to make a move. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI was really shy about it as expected and didn't know how to gracefully initiate. So instead I just imagined in my mind what to do, but I was in a dream so that thinking in my mind manifested into the actual dream and suddenly we were naked and in the act. I don't remember all the details but I remember it was passionate and in the moment. We experimented with different things and had a good time. I won't describe the details as to remain PG but the reason this is significant as stated above it because sexual acts are 99.99999999% never actually enacted in my dreams. I always attributed this to the fact that there is sparse sexual activity in my real life and therefore nothing to go off of but if my mind brings events from Fringe, which I've been watching nightly, then why would it enact sex as I do watch porn every now and then (not for the duration that I watch Fringe but watched regardless). \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAnd so now I hypothesize that this sexual enactment is the result of me journaling that it wasn't enacted just the previous dream entry and this stimulated or sponsored it occurring last night. This could be very significant indeed and in that case I still need to remember more of my dream scenes and to be much more lucid in my dreams. Request away to the back of my brain and to the cosmos! My answers await.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

It was late afternoon and seems like we all got together there after work as some of us were still in our business casual attire. We were smoking weed and drinking beers. When then drove around and parked outside of a neightborhood. Someone may have gone into one of their homes there and got something. We then we to a little cul-de-sac where a high school friend, Shawn C. lived. We went to the front door and rang the door bell. Shawn answered and when we opened the door there was a small tunnel like a metal drainage tunnel exatly similar metal to the one in the arroyo behind the Bob &amp; Alice Palace that Gabe and I traversed many many times in our youth. But this tunnel in my dream wasn't nearly as long. Twas only 7 or 9 feet long and led to Shawn's room. Where there were only 4 or so of us. Two guys and two girls. Ohh and at some point before or after going to Shawn's we went by the palace and Alice came with us so Alice was sitting there on the floor with us as we hung out and continued to drink and smoke. I remember her finding some of what we were doing/saying rude and tasteless but I explained to her there this was the custom. That's all I rmemeber of the dream. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI wish I could remember further back in my dreams. I think one key to this is writing these entried right out of bed.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

[Dream Journal Sept 24th 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The earliest back in my dreams last night I remember a zombie scene back in Los Alamos. I was with Zach M and we found a empty house that resembled mine in Tsikamo. We entered and began scavaging for things when K her sister and mom came home. We were glad to see them and re-grouped a little. Shortly after that K's dad came home. I don't remember him saying hi but Zach had begun taking apart the flat screen tv in the master bedroom and he pointed that out to us in a stern way. Before he could tell us what to do Zach had it back together. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI went outside and remember looking around at the mountains and feeling the warm breeze thinking that this zombie thing really made for a peaceful world. K came out shortly after. We talked for a little and then an encouter occured but was short lived. More of just a kind gesture on her behalf. Feeling pitty I assume. Or at least it ended with those ideas but that's not how it started. That's all I recall of the zombie scene. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nActaully I'm probably missing a transition here but next I recall being on a school bus headed for high-school. I was a few seats behind the middle of the bus on the left side and K and Matt S were a few seats ahead of me on the left side. K was more friendly and into Matt than he was. She was being her normal bubbly awesome self. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt was the first day of senior year. I skated around the school, not knowing where any of my classes were (this is a incident that happened in real life, both the skateboarding through school(a couple times), and the first day without getting my class papers till the bell rang although the two events on different occations). The first bell rang and I finally found a faculty office facade counter where students were lined up to get their class schedules and locker numbers ect... Shawn C was in line behind me. Was good to see him again. I got my class papers and my first class was called illuminati. I didn't pick the class and I remember wondering how it got there. I wondered the hall ways clueless and came across a classroom who's facade was elaborate greek and cathedral-like design. The room had no number and had a couple doors into it. I figured this matched the style for a class like this so I entered a door that was already slightly open. There was a large projector screen. The room coud have almost been two stories. The walls all held books like a library and everything was custom and ornate except the tile floor and desks. I walked straight in, not looking at anyone and found a desk to the right of the room which was the closest path to a desk from the door I enetered. The desks were all in a semi-circle around the projector and teacher. The teacher addressed me asking if I like being late and I settled still with my skateboard in my hands. I said &quot;Well Ye... No&quot;. I started to answer yes but the room was stern, no room for class clowns in this sanctuary of learning. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe were learning the historical events on video. Then K and Matt were there in a desk in front of me suddenly. K was answering the teach with a story about a little boy she was looking over at work. &quot;...and the boy just wouldn't kiss me&quot; as she sighed and leaned he her on Matt's chest. She said this as if this little boy not giving her a kiss on the cheek was improbable, but saying it in a manner that she was not obviously actually distressed, but more so playfully distressed. &quot;... and then I finished the story and he gave me a kiss finally&quot; not those exact words, but something similar. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt's been 7 years with K as a consistent dream character and in last night's dream she was in every scene. Quite persistent. What is this about? My conscience sentimental feelings for her other than caring for her like a sister are all but gone. I rarely think of her now and never even frequently in the past that I recall. Maybe it's from watching Ghost in the Shell and the character the Major, how she's always confident in herself and independent, noble, rightious, humorous/joking and of course physically attractive. But could that alone arise such a dream? Why didn't I just dream of the Major then? How deep is this in my subconscience and why? \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nTo be a human, alas. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;Mayan Pyramids, Tube Traveling and App Envy [Dream Journal Aug 9-11 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;I’ve missed the last three days in dreams so here is a shorter summer of each.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAug 9th 2013,&lt;br&gt;\n I dreamt I was on vacation visiting the Mayan Pyramids with some family friend’s family. I climbed to the top of one of the main pyramid’s with one of the uncles and when I got there lightning started to strike the flat top of the pyramid and we could see from where we were past some trees to a smaller stone structure that could be described as the shape of the frame of a hour glass only four or so stories high and made of stone. When the lightning hit it, it was captured inside where the sand of the hour glass would be. It started to glow a bright blue light and pulsated a little. I remember pointing it out to the uncle and being in awe, puzzled and grateful all at the same time to have seen it. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe second act of this dream I was driving in an old van with my friend Najee into the city of Chicago where he lived. We were going under a curved exit similar to one in Trenton and after a few minutes of driving we were at one of his family member’s homes. The van had broken down so we pulled in and parked outside the apartment complex with was right up to the sidewalk and Najee popped the hood. Under the hood the car was rather plain. Twas just mainly to rods sticking out of a plastic floor/frame where the engine usually is. Two steel metal rods, about a foot in length and 2 inches in width and with grooves like a screw. There was also some wiring going to the top of these and two smaller rods, only about 4 inches and then a box in the upper left that was probably the battery and a similar sized circuit/fuse box in the bottom right corner. The fuse box was designed for just two large fuses that had connectors on both ends. We tried removing one and starting the car, and re-inserting it and starting the car. We also unscrewed the two large rods from the car and then re-interested them. This was the end of what I recall.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAug 10th 2013,\nI remember being in a gym back in high-school. There was a group of kids that were outcasted and not treated as they should have been with respect. I went up to one of the guys who was a nice guy and started to explain to him that all he had to do to change was work out. I then went to explain how easy working out really was, “You just lift up and down and that’s it!”. I felt sorry for this crowd and thought that I could pick this one guy, pal up with him and get him muscular. While this wouldn’t guarantee acceptance, it would at least gain some respect points and at the same time make it nicer for the ladies in his life and is healthy all at the same time. We went to some small party together and instead of me leading him in a workout, he led me on some path that was very Alice-in-Wonderlandesque. We entered some sewer tunnels and then suddenly some of the tunnels were only the size of a silver dollar. I stopped before entering as it was too small to enter but he seemed to think this was the path we were taking. He simply leaned into the pipe head first and through the pipe he disappeared. I love adventures so I promptly did the same with little hesitation. Head first and it became like a twisting and turning water slide. We popped though a few of these and that was the end of this dream-act. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI was now back in Los Alamos in a separate instance of reality than the previous dream act. One that was closer to real-life reality. I was visiting Los Alamos. I remember being there for a few days staying somewhere by myself. I hung out with a few friends maybe three days for a couple hours each time over a week’s time (this didn’t enact, twas merely implied). I remember thinking, “Kristina’s really ignoring the fact that I’m here visiting.” When suddenly I was on a jog from Big Rock Loop towards the round-about and I was almost there when I saw Kristina coming down the road. She was holding on with her left arm to a truck as she jogged with it down the road. Blissfully as always, she said hi with a big genuine smile. We talked a little (although it didn’t enact) and she let go of the truck and we kept jogging into the trail at the round-about. Suddenly she was on a bike. She had explained to me that she was doing some sort of workouts that used only bikes to get around which involved many BMX maneuvers. Right off the road into the trail wasn’t like it was in real life. The forest was extremely thick and a tree had fallen in front of the trail. I remember thinking in my mind the BMX maneuver she could have used to traverse the log but after a moment she was off the bike and with her back on the ground, squeezing under the log (the forest was really really thick I’m telling you so this didn’t seem entirely not logical). It was a tight squeeze under the log and she got dirt all over her shirt and scraped against the log but didn’t think of it for a second. She was going to get past the log and she did, dirt or no dirt, mission accomplished. I paused in this moment and realized this was a big source of my love for this girl. Never in my life have I met a woman that would do that in a moment’s notice and not think a thing of it, let alone a woman that attractive. She is the only such I’ve met so far that is a true lady and half mountain goat at the same time. This was the end of what I remember of the dream-act.  \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAug 11th 2013,\nI remember I was visiting New Mexico in the current year, 2013 in a reality close to our real-life one. There was a scene of me driving with Sophia in Albuquerque headed somewhere to meet with family. A scene Sanjam and others were in a cafeteria of sorts. I pointed out Steve &amp; Stu were there down a few rows and a couple other people from NJ and said this would be a nice place for us all to take some time off. There was a dream of me playing a cheaper version of grand theft auto. It reminded me of my Die Hard game for Sega Saturn a little actually except with cars and I was duel wielding two shot guns at one point. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIn the final scene I was in Los Alamos, presumably at Gabe’s house although Gabe wasn’t there. It was his father Bill and some family friends that went without recognizable identities. I remember in the prior scene looking at a web design magazine and seeing all the cool apps people were coming out with. Now in this act Bill was looking at the same magazine and saying something along the lines of “Oh if I was young in this age”, implying that he would have loved to be young in this time and to be creative with app making and make money from it at the same time. This was all I remember from this dream-act. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

[Dream Journal Aug 7th 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;This dream is pretty random but here's what I remember. The farthest back I remember I was walking through the second floor of a building with a revolver on a mission of sorts. I remember being with two others on my team, a guy and a girl (which I think may have even been Agent Dunham and Lee from Fringe, not exactly them, but versions of them). But then it was just me wondering around a hallway with all the lights on. No one else was there on the floor. I went back downstairs which was a co-ed locker room of a gym seemingly. The lockers were blue and the grown was grey as it was just concrete. I went to a locker to change my clothes. There was a woman attending her locker a few rows down. She wasn't particularly attractive, a 5 or 6, but I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I should be polite and start a conversation&quot;. I believe she initiated a conversation and we had a friendly banter for a few minutes before leaving. I believe I met him before I got outside but there was a guy, maybe a couple years older than me, I didn't have a ride home so he offered to give me a lift. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe talked about a bunch of stuff but I don't recall details except for when we were outside at his truck I told him I was from New Mexico. Los Alamos, NM I remember saying it from a position of ego as Los Alamos is very much not a average place to be from. He didn't know where that was and so I fell back how I always do in that situation and explained it's where Los Alamos National Laboratory  is (no one usually knows what LANL is either so in the same line I have to include), where they built the atomic bomb. He didn't reply, didn't seem to care and was already thinking about something else. Suddenly he went from being just a friendly guy to exhibiting attraction towards me. I remember feeling unfortune and now having to deal with the change of events. We talked a little bit more outside and then went back inside to order a meal as the ground floor had now become a diner. I remember us going up to be seated and then suddenly I was but just me. The waiter came and I asked what happened to the person I walked in with and he explained how I had slipped away from him and sat myself here suddenly when he wasn't looking. I remember having scrambled eggs (eggs is what Walter and Olivia had last night in a episode of Fringe (I've been watching entirely too much Fringe)). Then I left and called my dad to give me a ride. He was asking why I didn't get a ride home and I told him I couldn't find one but he showed up in his truck and we left. That was all I remember of last night.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

I remember walking up a dirt driveway with a small outhouse before the house which the main house was the size of a double trailer (come to think of it, that part of Dan’s home was the same as our upstairs of our home in Tsikumu. We were in the living room area of my house and his and talking about something. Except there was a computer desktop desk against the sun facing wall where we were. It seemed in the dream he was always frowning and in a bad mood and cautious not to break any rules as his whole deminore was via the influence of his strict father. After hanging out like this for a few minutes we then went out to another outhouse in the front yard. From here we didn’t talk much, in fact Dan was outside much closer to the house than I was. I remember looking out from the house towards the neighbors and saw another friend from high school. I don’t recall his name. I remember he was looking sad and it was dark in his house. Not super dark but the lights weren’t on. He did lots of drugs and I had the impression from the dream that his dad wasn’t the nicest to him either. For a second seeing him sparked a thought/desire in my mind wondering when all the guys were going to get together that night and smoke and drink as per usual. Which is interesting to think now that that triggered that desire. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThen Jimmy came over and Sabrina &amp; Sara showed up shortly after. We were not hanging out in the originally described, smaller outhouse. Then Jimmy became a attractive blonde female (actually I don’t ever remember Jimmy being Jimmy in the dream at all), a 8.5 or 9 maybe. I remember thinking to myself that she was always just a really good friend but now after years being away and now that I was visiting again and older (older in my mind), I now suddenly found her attractive. I remember wanting to act on it somehow when all of a sudden there was a ruckus outside. Seems the neighbors, who was no longer the friend from high school from earlier, was upset about something we at Dan’s had done. Something that seemingly affected him but the exact thing was never made clear. So he backed his lawn mower onto the yard and unloaded a block of cut grass the dimensions of a sedan but only a third of the height. I remember I didn’t want to get Dan’s dad angry so I quickly and gracefully acted and began to clean up the grass. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThen the dream changed and I was at my home in New Jersey and I was working on some device. I was using trial and error to try out a bunch of different pieces for whatever I was building. I don’t remember exactly, twas extremely vague. Suddenly Scout, my dog was outside and when I got outside he was walking quickly down the side of the street. He then checked for cars and crossed over. The dream didn’t show him coming back and I didn’t go after him but suddenly he was back in the house and I was in the sun room with him again when he jumped up on the screen dog and pressed the handle open with his nose. He was suddenly off and down the street again crossing. That was all I remember.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

I had a glock and I was at the T intersection of one long hallway to another. I pressed against the edge of the hallway I was in and peered around the corner and there was a female agent also with a glock (probably the image comes from Olivia Dunham from watching so much Fringe lately). I think we exchanged a few shots when then started talking. I ended up just talking my way past 3 agents or so, all female and sex was implied, but the act never really enacted in my dream (I believe the sleeping past enemies comes from a game, MIM PUT). \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThen I think I got to where I was going and the dream changed somehow to where I was in a bed for days. The bed was in that same second hallway towards the end of it where I seemingly reached my destination. It’s size was similar to the bed I was actually sleeping on whilst I dreamt which makes me think at this point I may have been partially awake and aware of my surroundings in real life (aka the bed I was sleeping on). I was on this bed for days and all the while different women were entering and leaving the bed and I was seemingly sleeping with all of them although again the actual act never enacted in the dream, twas only implied. I remember one of them saying that she wished or liked that fact that I was such a huge (although she said huge she was really meaning famous) sex nerd and that was a big reason she was attracted to me but I remember thinking to myself, I’m not a huge famous sex nerd? And that was it.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;Old NM Friends [Dream Journal Aug 20th 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The first dream I remember from last night woke me from my sleep. Someone was explaining something to me in my dream and right when they said &quot;...and it happens on the number 13.&quot; I shot out of bed thinking it was 6:09am when I did which in my half asleep state I thought was related to 13 somehow and it freaked me out a little. One of my arms were completely numb when I popped out so that didn't help either. I used the rest room with my limp arm, getting it to wake up and then I went back to sleep. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nNow the earliest back in this next dream scene I remember (although I do remember it starting earlier), was walking into an old bowling alley type business on Main Street of a random an ol' town New Mexico style place. It was some type of bowling but not exactly. I was at the front desk which curved around in a long &quot;U&quot; shape where the two ends of the &quot;U&quot; met the wall of the facade of the building. An old white man with grey hair, maybe 80 or so was at the counter. There was some sort or verification/approval/paper process to allow us to enter the building and play the game that took a little time. After a few minutes three other guys joined the line native New Mexicans or the punk rocker type, all white and seemingly around my age. At first they didn't interact much but as we were approved and headed back to what was going to be like the locker room, we passed through some of the strangest architecture. Not like an alien style or anything, everything was still of the style of the old building just we walked through the strangest shaped doors and openings. Finally a very narrow opening. All the while each carrying a large bag of clothes (it was just him and I now, the dream rid his two friends). Through the narrow passage and down some equally small stairs we went into what looked like a furnished on room apartment. Of course everything was of the old/used style so the TV was a tube/analog one. It was on the basement level and there were small windows near the ceiling and where level with the sidewalk outside. I mentioned to him, man this place is trippy and he replied, I am tripping (like literally he was on drugs but he also thought the place was trippy). I turned to a darker cutout in the wall to put my stuff down. There were no lights on, just the light from the sidewalk windows but it was mid-day so everything was moderately lit. T dropped my bag in the dark cut out and like the Cheshire cat, Kristina was sitting in the cut out smiling with her hands on the floor by her sides leaning forward slightly. We exchanged some words, I don't know what exactly and then the scene changed.   \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI was back outside progressing further down the main street from the direction I had originated. I came to the end of Main Street where a empty dirt lot and a big tree grew. The kind that grow big and tall along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque with the small green leaves. Suddenly I came across the trio together there sitting in the sunny street, Katrina, Kristina and Kara. Completely chillaxed, enjoying the easy weather/breeze and the sun. We said 'hi' and exchanged words but I don't recall exactly. I remember saying something like &quot;oh it's you guys again, how nice.&quot; in a teasing/sarcastic way. I then went to lay in the opposite corner of the street, diagonally away from them as well, limbs fully stretched out and in the full sun (whereas they were in the full shade of the tree in the lot). I just laid there, trying to be even more chillax then they were while ignoring them a little. Of course they didn't care. Dylan H walked up on my side of the street and we exchanged some words that I forget. Scene change. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe were now fully down that street that was Main Street and it curved to the left and turned into houses instead of buildings along the street. I to one of the houses just where the curve ended. There were some college female students outside. I forget all the details, but it felt almost like a sorority but it wasn't, it was just someone's house that went to UNM and had some friends over. I guess what made it feel like a sorority or some official part of the college was there was a small fold-out table on the porch of the house where they were talking to people about something and then a mid-aged nurse showed up too for the college students to give some of shots. Then again Kristina, Kara and Katrina rolled up and got out. The nurse was making sure everyone had their shots and Kristina was dreading it because she knew she hadn't had hers yet. She said she hated doctor visits in a spaced out/distracted manner. She said she didn't want to get the shot but that chocolate always made it better. &quot;So let's have some chocolate then I said&quot;. She got excited and said &quot;Okay, I'll go get some&quot;. She came back with a chocolate cake and we used forks and ate right from the cake. Her actually getting the shot never enacted although the nurse was silently to the side of us watching and waiting, not creepily but just subtly there, almost not, as a dream figure. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe were eating the cake on a round wooden picnic table and many of our friends were with us at/around the table now too. Kristina was sitting on the table, I on its bench. We were talking and I remember me saying something worried and Kristina responded something like, &quot;but that's why you have me&quot; with a comforting/warm smile. I grabbed her arm just above elbow and leaned my head in a hug from the positioning of her on sitting upright on the table it made the hug positioned awkwardly like that but it didn't matter at that moment, the message was received. I remember thinking, &quot;maybe this time it's alright. Maybe this time I can just be here in this comfortable/safe/loving environment and everything was going to be okay.&quot; The dream ended and I awoke to cold, early reality, two thousand miles away. How did I get here?\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

You can pin different tiles to your home and my favorite is the pipeline total. How motivating is that to see a huge dollar amount waiting for you on your phone's home screen? It makes me feel like, &quot;Okay, what's next? Let's push it forward!&quot;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nOh and I don't know if you've ever received a lead from Twitter but, seems like Twitter is a friendly, less competitive route to go from my experience. Which reminds me, I wonder is there is a Hootsuite app for Windows Phone?...\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThere wasn't, but I would have bet against there being one.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;The Captain's Log - &amp;quot;Hobby-like&amp;quot; [Business Entry August 2nd 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;It's 4:40am. Up too late again but I had this revelation whilst in the rest room before bed abour keeping a business diary. I have a feeling I've thought this idea up at least once before but years ago and now that I'm keeping my dream journal I figured to add a business one. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise make a man healthy, weathly and wise. That's not been my pattern of late. I've been up till 3am and sleep till 11 or 12noon. It's not the most adventagious schedule and I beleive there is smoething to seeing the sun rise in the morning that is very boosting in a direct health way of sorts I hypothesize. So this un-worthy sleep cycle is needing to be replaced. My plan tonight (or this morning) is to wake up in a couple hours and power through the day just taking a few breaks every 15 minutes or so to scretch, work on some chores ect... and then retire at 10pm. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI re-fathomed recently that in any given day I'm awake 16 hours. Which in theory could give 12 hours to work and 4 to misc things. However it never really works out as planned. In fact for me plans have never ever worked. I blame myself and my dicipline, but because of my unsuccessful career of planning I now avoid them and have been opperating sometime without a written one. I need one. I need to spend time working out and meditating on my plan. I need my plan to be my mantra. I already have my vision in tact and it's been waiting for years now as I toil hobby-like trying to skip stones to the other side of the lake. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nNow about today. I spent about 6 hours or so (4 more hours than allotted) on my one of two client projects as I was working and re-working it to add a list of new specialty features that nor I or the client have insisted upon. I always do this. I turn each project from a business project, into a hobby-like one. Sure I always learn new things but it makes the project late and in-turn, very much not profitable working well below minimum wage surely all expenses aside. At least in this case the client understands mostly and in concerned that the project is profitable for me and doesn't want me to spend more hours than need be. This is litterally a first. I think it's a sign. The voice of God litterally coming through my client's mouth. Wrap that website up McDonald's style and get it out the door Mike! Your 24, this is and can no longer be a hooby business. A business that actually costs you money to opperate. Truely qualifies as a hobby and I'm not repeating the word hobby over and over again because it's been preached to me by a parent or relative becuase it really hasn't, I'm saying it because of it's features, namely the lack of profitability.  \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt's time to suit up. (I wonder if there is a proper/effective way to journal with intension like my intension is now with this first entry of my personal business journal). I think I'll call these, The Captain's Log, moving forward. Actually I'm going to change it now.  :)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

Code is still computer science in college course titles, no one thought to change it to computational blocks yet. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nYes frameworks, the amount of people coding and superset languages have made things easier to get a prototype online, but it's still code. They are still “languages” and there are multiple languages used in getting your idea online. If you were a contractor, already experienced and building houses and someone came to you and said to you “Hey I’ve got this great property by the ocean. You build a house there for me and when it sells, I’ll give you 10%!” Sounds… bad.\n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nAnd this is how it sounds when your looking for a developer for your startup: &lt;strong&gt;“Hey I’ve got this great app idea. You code it for me and I’ll give you 10%.”&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe, if it ever turns into anything, but you're up against 9/10 odds for your business' success. The point is, when you break it down to that simple form, it’s weak. It’s a bad deal on the developer’s side. Sure there are more developers now than ever but there are still not enough. This is why Mark Zuckerberg has teamed with Bill Gates and others to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;, because they (Mark &amp;amp; Bill) don’t have enough coders for their own growing businesses (Facebook &amp;amp; Microsoft) in a growing industry. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nThere are countless IT recruitment businesses. I can’t believe so many are in business it’s boggling to me. They are aggressive. They find talent and have them in their client’s office in a week or two and these jobs pay really well. If you want to find a quality developer off the streets to sit at your house and code for you, you're facing some steep competition and money.\n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nBack in the 90s, to have your own business was a very serious thing. The stigma back then was that you needed to go in with a hundred thousand or two and have all your ducks in a nice need row before you had any chance of maybe succeeding. Now the stigma has and is changing in our ever technologically advancing world towards anyone with an app idea feeling entitled to have that chance at becoming a iApp millionaire. Hopefully, younger developers and entrepreneurs won’t look back on this article in the near future (next 3 years maybe), when developing software for machines &amp;amp; devices is literally as simple/intuitive as stacking lego blocks and think that I was just a bitter old man, mouthing off in his own little blog post. I hope instead it reflects how I’m feeling in the present, just before lego block coding but facing an oncoming sea of startup ideas and the stigma that each is great and deserves a developer to code their idea. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\nI hope this article wasn’t too harsh. The good news we have a system in place here at BetaBulls to get your app idea online. We are lucky enough to already have a sturdy team of developers to bring your idea to life. We’re an idea factory. We make apps all day. If you're set on finding a lone developer for your startup, then please, don’t be discouraged by my writing above. They are out there and there are more and more everyday, but if you look and look and look and simply can’t find, remember that we’ll still be here waiting and ready to upstart your awesome app idea. \n\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;u&gt;Sincerely&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://mikeum.us/&quot;&gt;Michael Duane Mooring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

lol \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:48am\nSelini\nAnd in real life it can't be that way &lt;br&gt;\nThe FUCKING worst &lt;br&gt;\nIts the beginning of the end for. All future marriages  generations are literally and figuratively screwed &lt;br&gt;\nThis should be your next blog &lt;br&gt; \nI need it to be 7 so I can get up and swim laps &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:51am\nMichael Duane Mooring\nlol I actually did plan to blog about sex nerd stuff\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:51am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nMierda &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:52am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nthere is a really good podcast, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://sexnerdsandra.com/&quot;&gt;Sex Nerd Sandra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nand the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://pickuppodcast.com/&quot;&gt;Pickup Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which the host Jordan is much more respectable along with his company than the title would imply.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:53am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nI would blog about the porn age and how its taking society backwards rather then forward. Porn age= stone age\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:53am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nin my opinion, people wanting sex to be like they see in a porn, really aren't being in enough relationships to know that that's not real at all &lt;br&gt;\ncasue girls aren't like that &lt;br&gt;\nlol &lt;br&gt;\nand there needs to be so much communication &lt;br&gt;\nyou can't just run in there like it's a football game &lt;br&gt;\neven in a football game you talk about the plan before hand, lol\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:54am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nWell yes. But after enough desensitization to the male brain the ave female doesn't suffice any more.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:55am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nmaybe I'll just post this as a lazy blog post if you don't mind. I can have you anonymous if you'd like.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:55am &lt;br&gt;\nSelini &lt;br&gt;\nAnd that's were we fail &lt;br&gt;\nSure do it up \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:56am &lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring &lt;br&gt;\nlol, I don't think it's doom and gloom like your feeling. I think it's a matter of &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt;. I always have hope for humanity. Personally, I feel like me being this wise hermit that's not currently active sexually or relationship-wise creates a imbalance in nature and damages it somehow, lol.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:57am\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nHaha no I think more ppl need to be like you&lt;br&gt;\nAnd wait for the right one&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:57am&lt;br&gt;\nMichael Duane Mooring&lt;br&gt;\nyeah, till I'm 40, lol&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:58am\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nPhysical attractions fade when in a committed relationship&lt;br&gt;\nHahahahaha&lt;br&gt;\nNo no not that long \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n5:59am&lt;br&gt;\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nI mean people should date b4 they procreate&lt;br&gt;\nGo back to the basics\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n6:00am\nMichael Duane Mooring&lt;br&gt;\nyeah  I agree. There are more and more 'open-relationships' now too.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n6:02am\nMichael Duane Mooring&lt;br&gt;\nthere was a Pickup Podcast with a interview on open rela's but I'm not a fan and truthfully I'm not a fan of homosexuality either, again with the imbalance feeling/philosophy. If that one study showed that it's a actual growth on their brain, then that's like, a medical issue, not a sexual preference. And the one Dr.Oz episode with the gay guys that didn't want to be gay anymore, or feel gay.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n6:04am&lt;br&gt;\nSelini&lt;br&gt;\nYeah I think a lot of it is choice and some chemical imbalances&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;Dream Journal July 31th 2013&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The dream segment I remember from last night involved me being back in high school in a table/desk in a classroom after school with 4 or 5 other people around the table working on homework/studying. A teacher was there helping us. At some point, not sure if it was at this point or later but Caroline from Chairlift became the teacher with bright blonde but seemingly natural with 3 inches or so towards the end, ending in her natural brown hair color. I remember specifically how vivid and natural her hair looked and a very clean/clear parting of her hair in the back (If you can't tell by now, #fyi I have a huge crush on Caroline). We worked there for a while and I remember thinking how nice it was for the teacher to stay after school and help me. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAfter we all piled in a car and drove to a friend’s house with the teacher as the driver. We got there and first hung out up stairs for a while playing a computer game I was for a few minutes I believe with one of the kids that lived there. They had a big family, probably 5 kids, cats and dogs and the house was a little messy but not the worst. Then we went down stairs where they had a pool and a walk out basement (this was very similar in dimension to our old house in Los Alamos actually where my dad build our house with a similar walk out basement). I remember my cousin Andre was there and dived in the pool head first. I remember following after him trying to dive head first with my hands in front of me, but it didn't work and I more so belly flopped (I've never dove head first into water before in my life I don't think and I remember vaguely being at a pool after having too much to drink, diving off the diving board and flopping similarly). \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAfter my attempted dive I wasn't that far into the water but I put my feet against the edge of the pool and pushed deeper down. Then my feet were on the bottom and I continued to push around. Andre was swimming around underwater too. Then I got out and walked around the edge of the pool for a little. There was a row of desks and computers against the walk out face and again I went to watch one of the kids play a game. When I was down I looked back and the pool was empty. They had left me there. I remember feeling awkward at their home being left there and slightly let down and degraded. I believe I began walking home and then called my mom and let her know what had happened. And for some reason in the call I explained to her that part of the reason I had no ride back was because Gabe and I bought a fish. \n\nI do remember asking one character in my dream about something and he gave a definite answer. I always have a sub-awareness that I’m in a dream when I am and I believe I remember even asking him, if he was sure and he was. His answer felt external. He had a handlebar mustache. I remember receiving one other definite answer in the dream but I think it was of something of no consequence and may have had to do with fish or something similar again.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

Alice Palace in Big Rock Loop. Twas me and three other friends. They were childhood friends but their exactly identity was variable and delta. Outside of the house were three or so drag racing cars. We got in and blasted off headed uptown. The vehicles were very fast. Fast like we were going 60 and then could be going 80-90 in a second literally to catch up with out fellow drag racers. There were many square sections of pavement cut out of road, maybe about 3 or 4 on the way out of Big Rock Loop with construction crews of 3 or 2 people at some of them with orange protective helmets and tee shirts. I remember being concerned with hitting the sharp bumps resulting from the cut pavement going so fast but the car seemed to do fine over them. We sped uptown and ended up a Sonic. Although this Sonic was on the side of the soccer field where Matt B's house should have been.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

[Dream Journal Aug 3rd 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;This time I wasn't back in high school in my dream and I was back on the East Coast, not Los Alamos. Unfortunately I didn't log this right when I got out of bed but the farthest back I do remember is still significant. I was driving into NYC to some specific location for a meeting or event of sorts. It felt like it could have been business in nature. I remember getting lost and driving through some neighborhoods that were semi-sketchy but not too bad. I considered pulling over and figuring out where to go but didn't. I seemingly wasn't using a GPS. I remember leaving the neighborhood and getting back ore on a highway-like road. I remember driving through an overlapping intersection and feeling like I missed the correct forked exit. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI finally got to where I was going, some building that was closed/locked but I had a way prepared/known way in. Once inside I met up with a girl. Seems the event was actually a rendezvous with this girl. We were walking down the hallway of an office-like building, plain with carpeted floors. We got to the end of the hallway and a door on the left where we knew was locked and had a shipment of some sort of goods that we worked with together in our day-job (the context/feeling was that we didn't normally work in this building during out day job though). Suddenly we could hear someone coming. They were with someone or talking on the phone to someone. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nShe got excited and used the opportunity to ploy me into picking the lock (picking the lock may have come from seeing all the lock picking in Fringe) to sneak into the storage room, which really wasn't much of a storage room more so than an empty office with a few boxes cardboard inside. I remember we opened one of the boxes with my Swiss army knife but the contents where never shown or used in the dream. After almost 30 minutes or so of just sitting on the floor talking, doing nothing, we were not talking and it was time to do something. We had obviously met here secretly for a reason and it was time to make a move. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI was really shy about it as expected and didn't know how to gracefully initiate. So instead I just imagined in my mind what to do, but I was in a dream so that thinking in my mind manifested into the actual dream and suddenly we were naked and in the act. I don't remember all the details but I remember it was passionate and in the moment. We experimented with different things and had a good time. I won't describe the details as to remain PG but the reason this is significant as stated above it because sexual acts are 99.99999999% never actually enacted in my dreams. I always attributed this to the fact that there is sparse sexual activity in my real life and therefore nothing to go off of but if my mind brings events from Fringe, which I've been watching nightly, then why would it enact sex as I do watch porn every now and then (not for the duration that I watch Fringe but watched regardless). \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAnd so now I hypothesize that this sexual enactment is the result of me journaling that it wasn't enacted just the previous dream entry and this stimulated or sponsored it occurring last night. This could be very significant indeed and in that case I still need to remember more of my dream scenes and to be much more lucid in my dreams. Request away to the back of my brain and to the cosmos! My answers await.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

It was late afternoon and seems like we all got together there after work as some of us were still in our business casual attire. We were smoking weed and drinking beers. When then drove around and parked outside of a neightborhood. Someone may have gone into one of their homes there and got something. We then we to a little cul-de-sac where a high school friend, Shawn C. lived. We went to the front door and rang the door bell. Shawn answered and when we opened the door there was a small tunnel like a metal drainage tunnel exatly similar metal to the one in the arroyo behind the Bob &amp; Alice Palace that Gabe and I traversed many many times in our youth. But this tunnel in my dream wasn't nearly as long. Twas only 7 or 9 feet long and led to Shawn's room. Where there were only 4 or so of us. Two guys and two girls. Ohh and at some point before or after going to Shawn's we went by the palace and Alice came with us so Alice was sitting there on the floor with us as we hung out and continued to drink and smoke. I remember her finding some of what we were doing/saying rude and tasteless but I explained to her there this was the custom. That's all I rmemeber of the dream. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI wish I could remember further back in my dreams. I think one key to this is writing these entried right out of bed.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

[Dream Journal Sept 24th 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The earliest back in my dreams last night I remember a zombie scene back in Los Alamos. I was with Zach M and we found a empty house that resembled mine in Tsikamo. We entered and began scavaging for things when K her sister and mom came home. We were glad to see them and re-grouped a little. Shortly after that K's dad came home. I don't remember him saying hi but Zach had begun taking apart the flat screen tv in the master bedroom and he pointed that out to us in a stern way. Before he could tell us what to do Zach had it back together. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI went outside and remember looking around at the mountains and feeling the warm breeze thinking that this zombie thing really made for a peaceful world. K came out shortly after. We talked for a little and then an encouter occured but was short lived. More of just a kind gesture on her behalf. Feeling pitty I assume. Or at least it ended with those ideas but that's not how it started. That's all I recall of the zombie scene. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nActaully I'm probably missing a transition here but next I recall being on a school bus headed for high-school. I was a few seats behind the middle of the bus on the left side and K and Matt S were a few seats ahead of me on the left side. K was more friendly and into Matt than he was. She was being her normal bubbly awesome self. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt was the first day of senior year. I skated around the school, not knowing where any of my classes were (this is a incident that happened in real life, both the skateboarding through school(a couple times), and the first day without getting my class papers till the bell rang although the two events on different occations). The first bell rang and I finally found a faculty office facade counter where students were lined up to get their class schedules and locker numbers ect... Shawn C was in line behind me. Was good to see him again. I got my class papers and my first class was called illuminati. I didn't pick the class and I remember wondering how it got there. I wondered the hall ways clueless and came across a classroom who's facade was elaborate greek and cathedral-like design. The room had no number and had a couple doors into it. I figured this matched the style for a class like this so I entered a door that was already slightly open. There was a large projector screen. The room coud have almost been two stories. The walls all held books like a library and everything was custom and ornate except the tile floor and desks. I walked straight in, not looking at anyone and found a desk to the right of the room which was the closest path to a desk from the door I enetered. The desks were all in a semi-circle around the projector and teacher. The teacher addressed me asking if I like being late and I settled still with my skateboard in my hands. I said &quot;Well Ye... No&quot;. I started to answer yes but the room was stern, no room for class clowns in this sanctuary of learning. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe were learning the historical events on video. Then K and Matt were there in a desk in front of me suddenly. K was answering the teach with a story about a little boy she was looking over at work. &quot;...and the boy just wouldn't kiss me&quot; as she sighed and leaned he her on Matt's chest. She said this as if this little boy not giving her a kiss on the cheek was improbable, but saying it in a manner that she was not obviously actually distressed, but more so playfully distressed. &quot;... and then I finished the story and he gave me a kiss finally&quot; not those exact words, but something similar. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt's been 7 years with K as a consistent dream character and in last night's dream she was in every scene. Quite persistent. What is this about? My conscience sentimental feelings for her other than caring for her like a sister are all but gone. I rarely think of her now and never even frequently in the past that I recall. Maybe it's from watching Ghost in the Shell and the character the Major, how she's always confident in herself and independent, noble, rightious, humorous/joking and of course physically attractive. But could that alone arise such a dream? Why didn't I just dream of the Major then? How deep is this in my subconscience and why? \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nTo be a human, alas. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;Mayan Pyramids, Tube Traveling and App Envy [Dream Journal Aug 9-11 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;I’ve missed the last three days in dreams so here is a shorter summer of each.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAug 9th 2013,&lt;br&gt;\n I dreamt I was on vacation visiting the Mayan Pyramids with some family friend’s family. I climbed to the top of one of the main pyramid’s with one of the uncles and when I got there lightning started to strike the flat top of the pyramid and we could see from where we were past some trees to a smaller stone structure that could be described as the shape of the frame of a hour glass only four or so stories high and made of stone. When the lightning hit it, it was captured inside where the sand of the hour glass would be. It started to glow a bright blue light and pulsated a little. I remember pointing it out to the uncle and being in awe, puzzled and grateful all at the same time to have seen it. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe second act of this dream I was driving in an old van with my friend Najee into the city of Chicago where he lived. We were going under a curved exit similar to one in Trenton and after a few minutes of driving we were at one of his family member’s homes. The van had broken down so we pulled in and parked outside the apartment complex with was right up to the sidewalk and Najee popped the hood. Under the hood the car was rather plain. Twas just mainly to rods sticking out of a plastic floor/frame where the engine usually is. Two steel metal rods, about a foot in length and 2 inches in width and with grooves like a screw. There was also some wiring going to the top of these and two smaller rods, only about 4 inches and then a box in the upper left that was probably the battery and a similar sized circuit/fuse box in the bottom right corner. The fuse box was designed for just two large fuses that had connectors on both ends. We tried removing one and starting the car, and re-inserting it and starting the car. We also unscrewed the two large rods from the car and then re-interested them. This was the end of what I recall.\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAug 10th 2013,\nI remember being in a gym back in high-school. There was a group of kids that were outcasted and not treated as they should have been with respect. I went up to one of the guys who was a nice guy and started to explain to him that all he had to do to change was work out. I then went to explain how easy working out really was, “You just lift up and down and that’s it!”. I felt sorry for this crowd and thought that I could pick this one guy, pal up with him and get him muscular. While this wouldn’t guarantee acceptance, it would at least gain some respect points and at the same time make it nicer for the ladies in his life and is healthy all at the same time. We went to some small party together and instead of me leading him in a workout, he led me on some path that was very Alice-in-Wonderlandesque. We entered some sewer tunnels and then suddenly some of the tunnels were only the size of a silver dollar. I stopped before entering as it was too small to enter but he seemed to think this was the path we were taking. He simply leaned into the pipe head first and through the pipe he disappeared. I love adventures so I promptly did the same with little hesitation. Head first and it became like a twisting and turning water slide. We popped though a few of these and that was the end of this dream-act. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI was now back in Los Alamos in a separate instance of reality than the previous dream act. One that was closer to real-life reality. I was visiting Los Alamos. I remember being there for a few days staying somewhere by myself. I hung out with a few friends maybe three days for a couple hours each time over a week’s time (this didn’t enact, twas merely implied). I remember thinking, “Kristina’s really ignoring the fact that I’m here visiting.” When suddenly I was on a jog from Big Rock Loop towards the round-about and I was almost there when I saw Kristina coming down the road. She was holding on with her left arm to a truck as she jogged with it down the road. Blissfully as always, she said hi with a big genuine smile. We talked a little (although it didn’t enact) and she let go of the truck and we kept jogging into the trail at the round-about. Suddenly she was on a bike. She had explained to me that she was doing some sort of workouts that used only bikes to get around which involved many BMX maneuvers. Right off the road into the trail wasn’t like it was in real life. The forest was extremely thick and a tree had fallen in front of the trail. I remember thinking in my mind the BMX maneuver she could have used to traverse the log but after a moment she was off the bike and with her back on the ground, squeezing under the log (the forest was really really thick I’m telling you so this didn’t seem entirely not logical). It was a tight squeeze under the log and she got dirt all over her shirt and scraped against the log but didn’t think of it for a second. She was going to get past the log and she did, dirt or no dirt, mission accomplished. I paused in this moment and realized this was a big source of my love for this girl. Never in my life have I met a woman that would do that in a moment’s notice and not think a thing of it, let alone a woman that attractive. She is the only such I’ve met so far that is a true lady and half mountain goat at the same time. This was the end of what I remember of the dream-act.  \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nAug 11th 2013,\nI remember I was visiting New Mexico in the current year, 2013 in a reality close to our real-life one. There was a scene of me driving with Sophia in Albuquerque headed somewhere to meet with family. A scene Sanjam and others were in a cafeteria of sorts. I pointed out Steve &amp; Stu were there down a few rows and a couple other people from NJ and said this would be a nice place for us all to take some time off. There was a dream of me playing a cheaper version of grand theft auto. It reminded me of my Die Hard game for Sega Saturn a little actually except with cars and I was duel wielding two shot guns at one point. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIn the final scene I was in Los Alamos, presumably at Gabe’s house although Gabe wasn’t there. It was his father Bill and some family friends that went without recognizable identities. I remember in the prior scene looking at a web design magazine and seeing all the cool apps people were coming out with. Now in this act Bill was looking at the same magazine and saying something along the lines of “Oh if I was young in this age”, implying that he would have loved to be young in this time and to be creative with app making and make money from it at the same time. This was all I remember from this dream-act. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

[Dream Journal Aug 7th 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;This dream is pretty random but here's what I remember. The farthest back I remember I was walking through the second floor of a building with a revolver on a mission of sorts. I remember being with two others on my team, a guy and a girl (which I think may have even been Agent Dunham and Lee from Fringe, not exactly them, but versions of them). But then it was just me wondering around a hallway with all the lights on. No one else was there on the floor. I went back downstairs which was a co-ed locker room of a gym seemingly. The lockers were blue and the grown was grey as it was just concrete. I went to a locker to change my clothes. There was a woman attending her locker a few rows down. She wasn't particularly attractive, a 5 or 6, but I remember thinking to myself, &quot;I should be polite and start a conversation&quot;. I believe she initiated a conversation and we had a friendly banter for a few minutes before leaving. I believe I met him before I got outside but there was a guy, maybe a couple years older than me, I didn't have a ride home so he offered to give me a lift. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe talked about a bunch of stuff but I don't recall details except for when we were outside at his truck I told him I was from New Mexico. Los Alamos, NM I remember saying it from a position of ego as Los Alamos is very much not a average place to be from. He didn't know where that was and so I fell back how I always do in that situation and explained it's where Los Alamos National Laboratory  is (no one usually knows what LANL is either so in the same line I have to include), where they built the atomic bomb. He didn't reply, didn't seem to care and was already thinking about something else. Suddenly he went from being just a friendly guy to exhibiting attraction towards me. I remember feeling unfortune and now having to deal with the change of events. We talked a little bit more outside and then went back inside to order a meal as the ground floor had now become a diner. I remember us going up to be seated and then suddenly I was but just me. The waiter came and I asked what happened to the person I walked in with and he explained how I had slipped away from him and sat myself here suddenly when he wasn't looking. I remember having scrambled eggs (eggs is what Walter and Olivia had last night in a episode of Fringe (I've been watching entirely too much Fringe)). Then I left and called my dad to give me a ride. He was asking why I didn't get a ride home and I told him I couldn't find one but he showed up in his truck and we left. That was all I remember of last night.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

I remember walking up a dirt driveway with a small outhouse before the house which the main house was the size of a double trailer (come to think of it, that part of Dan’s home was the same as our upstairs of our home in Tsikumu. We were in the living room area of my house and his and talking about something. Except there was a computer desktop desk against the sun facing wall where we were. It seemed in the dream he was always frowning and in a bad mood and cautious not to break any rules as his whole deminore was via the influence of his strict father. After hanging out like this for a few minutes we then went out to another outhouse in the front yard. From here we didn’t talk much, in fact Dan was outside much closer to the house than I was. I remember looking out from the house towards the neighbors and saw another friend from high school. I don’t recall his name. I remember he was looking sad and it was dark in his house. Not super dark but the lights weren’t on. He did lots of drugs and I had the impression from the dream that his dad wasn’t the nicest to him either. For a second seeing him sparked a thought/desire in my mind wondering when all the guys were going to get together that night and smoke and drink as per usual. Which is interesting to think now that that triggered that desire. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThen Jimmy came over and Sabrina &amp; Sara showed up shortly after. We were not hanging out in the originally described, smaller outhouse. Then Jimmy became a attractive blonde female (actually I don’t ever remember Jimmy being Jimmy in the dream at all), a 8.5 or 9 maybe. I remember thinking to myself that she was always just a really good friend but now after years being away and now that I was visiting again and older (older in my mind), I now suddenly found her attractive. I remember wanting to act on it somehow when all of a sudden there was a ruckus outside. Seems the neighbors, who was no longer the friend from high school from earlier, was upset about something we at Dan’s had done. Something that seemingly affected him but the exact thing was never made clear. So he backed his lawn mower onto the yard and unloaded a block of cut grass the dimensions of a sedan but only a third of the height. I remember I didn’t want to get Dan’s dad angry so I quickly and gracefully acted and began to clean up the grass. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThen the dream changed and I was at my home in New Jersey and I was working on some device. I was using trial and error to try out a bunch of different pieces for whatever I was building. I don’t remember exactly, twas extremely vague. Suddenly Scout, my dog was outside and when I got outside he was walking quickly down the side of the street. He then checked for cars and crossed over. The dream didn’t show him coming back and I didn’t go after him but suddenly he was back in the house and I was in the sun room with him again when he jumped up on the screen dog and pressed the handle open with his nose. He was suddenly off and down the street again crossing. That was all I remember.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

I had a glock and I was at the T intersection of one long hallway to another. I pressed against the edge of the hallway I was in and peered around the corner and there was a female agent also with a glock (probably the image comes from Olivia Dunham from watching so much Fringe lately). I think we exchanged a few shots when then started talking. I ended up just talking my way past 3 agents or so, all female and sex was implied, but the act never really enacted in my dream (I believe the sleeping past enemies comes from a game, MIM PUT). \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThen I think I got to where I was going and the dream changed somehow to where I was in a bed for days. The bed was in that same second hallway towards the end of it where I seemingly reached my destination. It’s size was similar to the bed I was actually sleeping on whilst I dreamt which makes me think at this point I may have been partially awake and aware of my surroundings in real life (aka the bed I was sleeping on). I was on this bed for days and all the while different women were entering and leaving the bed and I was seemingly sleeping with all of them although again the actual act never enacted in the dream, twas only implied. I remember one of them saying that she wished or liked that fact that I was such a huge (although she said huge she was really meaning famous) sex nerd and that was a big reason she was attracted to me but I remember thinking to myself, I’m not a huge famous sex nerd? And that was it.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;Old NM Friends [Dream Journal Aug 20th 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;The first dream I remember from last night woke me from my sleep. Someone was explaining something to me in my dream and right when they said &quot;...and it happens on the number 13.&quot; I shot out of bed thinking it was 6:09am when I did which in my half asleep state I thought was related to 13 somehow and it freaked me out a little. One of my arms were completely numb when I popped out so that didn't help either. I used the rest room with my limp arm, getting it to wake up and then I went back to sleep. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nNow the earliest back in this next dream scene I remember (although I do remember it starting earlier), was walking into an old bowling alley type business on Main Street of a random an ol' town New Mexico style place. It was some type of bowling but not exactly. I was at the front desk which curved around in a long &quot;U&quot; shape where the two ends of the &quot;U&quot; met the wall of the facade of the building. An old white man with grey hair, maybe 80 or so was at the counter. There was some sort or verification/approval/paper process to allow us to enter the building and play the game that took a little time. After a few minutes three other guys joined the line native New Mexicans or the punk rocker type, all white and seemingly around my age. At first they didn't interact much but as we were approved and headed back to what was going to be like the locker room, we passed through some of the strangest architecture. Not like an alien style or anything, everything was still of the style of the old building just we walked through the strangest shaped doors and openings. Finally a very narrow opening. All the while each carrying a large bag of clothes (it was just him and I now, the dream rid his two friends). Through the narrow passage and down some equally small stairs we went into what looked like a furnished on room apartment. Of course everything was of the old/used style so the TV was a tube/analog one. It was on the basement level and there were small windows near the ceiling and where level with the sidewalk outside. I mentioned to him, man this place is trippy and he replied, I am tripping (like literally he was on drugs but he also thought the place was trippy). I turned to a darker cutout in the wall to put my stuff down. There were no lights on, just the light from the sidewalk windows but it was mid-day so everything was moderately lit. T dropped my bag in the dark cut out and like the Cheshire cat, Kristina was sitting in the cut out smiling with her hands on the floor by her sides leaning forward slightly. We exchanged some words, I don't know what exactly and then the scene changed.   \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI was back outside progressing further down the main street from the direction I had originated. I came to the end of Main Street where a empty dirt lot and a big tree grew. The kind that grow big and tall along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque with the small green leaves. Suddenly I came across the trio together there sitting in the sunny street, Katrina, Kristina and Kara. Completely chillaxed, enjoying the easy weather/breeze and the sun. We said 'hi' and exchanged words but I don't recall exactly. I remember saying something like &quot;oh it's you guys again, how nice.&quot; in a teasing/sarcastic way. I then went to lay in the opposite corner of the street, diagonally away from them as well, limbs fully stretched out and in the full sun (whereas they were in the full shade of the tree in the lot). I just laid there, trying to be even more chillax then they were while ignoring them a little. Of course they didn't care. Dylan H walked up on my side of the street and we exchanged some words that I forget. Scene change. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe were now fully down that street that was Main Street and it curved to the left and turned into houses instead of buildings along the street. I to one of the houses just where the curve ended. There were some college female students outside. I forget all the details, but it felt almost like a sorority but it wasn't, it was just someone's house that went to UNM and had some friends over. I guess what made it feel like a sorority or some official part of the college was there was a small fold-out table on the porch of the house where they were talking to people about something and then a mid-aged nurse showed up too for the college students to give some of shots. Then again Kristina, Kara and Katrina rolled up and got out. The nurse was making sure everyone had their shots and Kristina was dreading it because she knew she hadn't had hers yet. She said she hated doctor visits in a spaced out/distracted manner. She said she didn't want to get the shot but that chocolate always made it better. &quot;So let's have some chocolate then I said&quot;. She got excited and said &quot;Okay, I'll go get some&quot;. She came back with a chocolate cake and we used forks and ate right from the cake. Her actually getting the shot never enacted although the nurse was silently to the side of us watching and waiting, not creepily but just subtly there, almost not, as a dream figure. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWe were eating the cake on a round wooden picnic table and many of our friends were with us at/around the table now too. Kristina was sitting on the table, I on its bench. We were talking and I remember me saying something worried and Kristina responded something like, &quot;but that's why you have me&quot; with a comforting/warm smile. I grabbed her arm just above elbow and leaned my head in a hug from the positioning of her on sitting upright on the table it made the hug positioned awkwardly like that but it didn't matter at that moment, the message was received. I remember thinking, &quot;maybe this time it's alright. Maybe this time I can just be here in this comfortable/safe/loving environment and everything was going to be okay.&quot; The dream ended and I awoke to cold, early reality, two thousand miles away. How did I get here?\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

You can pin different tiles to your home and my favorite is the pipeline total. How motivating is that to see a huge dollar amount waiting for you on your phone's home screen? It makes me feel like, &quot;Okay, what's next? Let's push it forward!&quot;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nOh and I don't know if you've ever received a lead from Twitter but, seems like Twitter is a friendly, less competitive route to go from my experience. Which reminds me, I wonder is there is a Hootsuite app for Windows Phone?...\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThere wasn't, but I would have bet against there being one.

class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;h1&gt;The Captain's Log - &amp;quot;Hobby-like&amp;quot; [Business Entry August 2nd 2013]&lt;/h1&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;It's 4:40am. Up too late again but I had this revelation whilst in the rest room before bed abour keeping a business diary. I have a feeling I've thought this idea up at least once before but years ago and now that I'm keeping my dream journal I figured to add a business one. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise make a man healthy, weathly and wise. That's not been my pattern of late. I've been up till 3am and sleep till 11 or 12noon. It's not the most adventagious schedule and I beleive there is smoething to seeing the sun rise in the morning that is very boosting in a direct health way of sorts I hypothesize. So this un-worthy sleep cycle is needing to be replaced. My plan tonight (or this morning) is to wake up in a couple hours and power through the day just taking a few breaks every 15 minutes or so to scretch, work on some chores ect... and then retire at 10pm. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nI re-fathomed recently that in any given day I'm awake 16 hours. Which in theory could give 12 hours to work and 4 to misc things. However it never really works out as planned. In fact for me plans have never ever worked. I blame myself and my dicipline, but because of my unsuccessful career of planning I now avoid them and have been opperating sometime without a written one. I need one. I need to spend time working out and meditating on my plan. I need my plan to be my mantra. I already have my vision in tact and it's been waiting for years now as I toil hobby-like trying to skip stones to the other side of the lake. \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nNow about today. I spent about 6 hours or so (4 more hours than allotted) on my one of two client projects as I was working and re-working it to add a list of new specialty features that nor I or the client have insisted upon. I always do this. I turn each project from a business project, into a hobby-like one. Sure I always learn new things but it makes the project late and in-turn, very much not profitable working well below minimum wage surely all expenses aside. At least in this case the client understands mostly and in concerned that the project is profitable for me and doesn't want me to spend more hours than need be. This is litterally a first. I think it's a sign. The voice of God litterally coming through my client's mouth. Wrap that website up McDonald's style and get it out the door Mike! Your 24, this is and can no longer be a hooby business. A business that actually costs you money to opperate. Truely qualifies as a hobby and I'm not repeating the word hobby over and over again because it's been preached to me by a parent or relative becuase it really hasn't, I'm saying it because of it's features, namely the lack of profitability.  \n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nIt's time to suit up. (I wonder if there is a proper/effective way to journal with intension like my intension is now with this first entry of my personal business journal). I think I'll call these, The Captain's Log, moving forward. Actually I'm going to change it now.  :)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n&lt;footer&gt;\n\t\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div class=&quot;footer pure-u-1&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&amp;copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- iconmonstr START --&gt;&lt;svg id=&quot;os&quot; class=&quot;os&quot; rel=&quot;tipsy&quot; data-placement=&quot;above&quot; data-content=&quot;Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com &amp; hosted via Github Pages.

I have a feeling I've thought this idea up at least once before but years ago and now that I'm keeping my dream journal I figured to add a business one. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise make a man healthy, weathly and wise. That's not been my pattern of late. I've been up till 3am and sleep till 11 or 12noon. It's not the most adventagious schedule and I beleive there is smoething to seeing the sun rise in the morning that is very boosting in a direct health way of sorts I hypothesize. So this un-worthy sleep cycle is needing to be replaced. My plan tonight (or this morning) is to wake up in a couple hours and power through the day just taking a few breaks every 15 minutes or so to scretch, work on some chores ect... and then retire at 10pm. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI re-fathomed recently that in any given day I'm awake 16 hours. Which in theory could give 12 hours to work and 4 to misc things. However it never really works out as planned. In fact for me plans have never ever worked. I blame myself and my dicipline, but because of my unsuccessful career of planning I now avoid them and have been opperating sometime without a written one. I need one. I need to spend time working out and meditating on my plan. I need my plan to be my mantra. I already have my vision in tact and it's been waiting for years now as I toil hobby-like trying to skip stones to the other side of the lake. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nNow about today. I spent about 6 hours or so (4 more hours than allotted) on my one of two client projects as I was working and re-working it to add a list of new specialty features that nor I or the client have insisted upon. I always do this. I turn each project from a business project, into a hobby-like one. Sure I always learn new things but it makes the project late and in-turn, very much not profitable working well below minimum wage surely all expenses aside. At least in this case the client understands mostly and in concerned that the project is profitable for me and doesn't want me to spend more hours than need be. This is litterally a first. I think it's a sign. The voice of God litterally coming through my client's mouth. Wrap that website up McDonald's style and get it out the door Mike! Your 24, this is and can no longer be a hooby business. A business that actually costs you money to opperate. Truely qualifies as a hobby and I'm not repeating the word hobby over and over again because it's been preached to me by a parent or relative becuase it really hasn't, I'm saying it because of it's features, namely the lack of profitability.  \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nIt's time to suit up. (I wonder if there is a proper/effective way to journal with intension like my intension is now with this first entry of my personal business journal).

Up too late again but I had this revelation whilst in the rest room before bed abour keeping a business diary. I have a feeling I've thought this idea up at least once before but years ago and now that I'm keeping my dream journal I figured to add a business one. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nEarly to bed, early to rise make a man healthy, weathly and wise. That's not been my pattern of late. I've been up till 3am and sleep till 11 or 12noon. It's not the most adventagious schedule and I beleive there is smoething to seeing the sun rise in the morning that is very boosting in a direct health way of sorts I hypothesize. So this un-worthy sleep cycle is needing to be replaced. My plan tonight (or this morning) is to wake up in a couple hours and power through the day just taking a few breaks every 15 minutes or so to scretch, work on some chores ect... and then retire at 10pm. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI re-fathomed recently that in any given day I'm awake 16 hours. Which in theory could give 12 hours to work and 4 to misc things. However it never really works out as planned. In fact for me plans have never ever worked. I blame myself and my dicipline, but because of my unsuccessful career of planning I now avoid them and have been opperating sometime without a written one. I need one. I need to spend time working out and meditating on my plan. I need my plan to be my mantra. I already have my vision in tact and it's been waiting for years now as I toil hobby-like trying to skip stones to the other side of the lake. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nNow about today. I spent about 6 hours or so (4 more hours than allotted) on my one of two client projects as I was working and re-working it to add a list of new specialty features that nor I or the client have insisted upon. I always do this. I turn each project from a business project, into a hobby-like one. Sure I always learn new things but it makes the project late and in-turn, very much not profitable working well below minimum wage surely all expenses aside. At least in this case the client understands mostly and in concerned that the project is profitable for me and doesn't want me to spend more hours than need be. This is litterally a first. I think it's a sign. The voice of God litterally coming through my client's mouth. Wrap that website up McDonald's style and get it out the door Mike! Your 24, this is and can no longer be a hooby business. A business that actually costs you money to opperate. Truely qualifies as a hobby and I'm not repeating the word hobby over and over again because it's been preached to me by a parent or relative becuase it really hasn't, I'm saying it because of it's features, namely the lack of profitability.  \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nIt's time to suit up. (I wonder if there is a proper/effective way to journal with intension like my intension is now with this first entry of my personal business journal). I think I'll call these, The Captain's Log, moving forward. Actually I'm going to change it now.  :)</div>\n</article>\n\n<footer>\n\t\n</footer>\n\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"footer pure-u-1\">\n\t\t&copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ <a href=\"https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us\" target=\"_blank\"><!-- iconmonstr START --><svg id=\"os\" class=\"os\" rel=\"tipsy\" data-placement=\"above\" data-content=\"Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com & hosted via Github Pages.

If this was the right place for me. I am really rooting for some alternate-universe versions of me after this dream reminded me of if I had choose a simpler life.\"'\n---\n\nThe first dream I remember from last night woke me from my sleep. Someone was explaining something to me in my dream and right when they said \"...and it happens on the number 13.\" I shot out of bed thinking it was 6:09am when I did which in my half asleep state I thought was related to 13 somehow and it freaked me out a little. One of my arms were completely numb when I popped out so that didn't help either. I used the rest room with my limp arm, getting it to wake up and then I went back to sleep. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nNow the earliest back in this next dream scene I remember (although I do remember it starting earlier), was walking into an old bowling alley type business on Main Street of a random an ol' town New Mexico style place. It was some type of bowling but not exactly. I was at the front desk which curved around in a long \"U\" shape where the two ends of the \"U\" met the wall of the facade of the building. An old white man with grey hair, maybe 80 or so was at the counter. There was some sort or verification/approval/paper process to allow us to enter the building and play the game that took a little time. After a few minutes three other guys joined the line native New Mexicans or the punk rocker type, all white and seemingly around my age. At first they didn't interact much but as we were approved and headed back to what was going to be like the locker room, we passed through some of the strangest architecture. Not like an alien style or anything, everything was still of the style of the old building just we walked through the strangest shaped doors and openings. Finally a very narrow opening. All the while each carrying a large bag of clothes (it was just him and I now, the dream rid his two friends). Through the narrow passage and down some equally small stairs we went into what looked like a furnished on room apartment. Of course everything was of the old/used style so the TV was a tube/analog one. It was on the basement level and there were small windows near the ceiling and where level with the sidewalk outside. I mentioned to him, man this place is trippy and he replied, I am tripping (like literally he was on drugs but he also thought the place was trippy). I turned to a darker cutout in the wall to put my stuff down. There were no lights on, just the light from the sidewalk windows but it was mid-day so everything was moderately lit. T dropped my bag in the dark cut out and like the Cheshire cat, Kristina was sitting in the cut out smiling with her hands on the floor by her sides leaning forward slightly. We exchanged some words, I don't know what exactly and then the scene changed.   \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI was back outside progressing further down the main street from the direction I had originated. I came to the end of Main Street where a empty dirt lot and a big tree grew. The kind that grow big and tall along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque with the small green leaves. Suddenly I came across the trio together there sitting in the sunny street, Katrina, Kristina and Kara. Completely chillaxed, enjoying the easy weather/breeze and the sun. We said 'hi' and exchanged words but I don't recall exactly. I remember saying something like \"oh it's you guys again, how nice.\" in a teasing/sarcastic way. I then went to lay in the opposite corner of the street, diagonally away from them as well, limbs fully stretched out and in the full sun (whereas they were in the full shade of the tree in the lot). I just laid there, trying to be even more chillax then they were while ignoring them a little. Of course they didn't care. Dylan H walked up on my side of the street and we exchanged some words that I forget. Scene change. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nWe were now fully down that street that was Main Street and it curved to the left and turned into houses instead of buildings along the street. I to one of the houses just where the curve ended. There were some college female students outside. I forget all the details, but it felt almost like a sorority but it wasn't, it was just someone's house that went to UNM and had some friends over. I guess what made it feel like a sorority or some official part of the college was there was a small fold-out table on the porch of the house where they were talking to people about something and then a mid-aged nurse showed up too for the college students to give some of shots. Then again Kristina, Kara and Katrina rolled up and got out. The nurse was making sure everyone had their shots and Kristina was dreading it because she knew she hadn't had hers yet. She said she hated doctor visits in a spaced out/distracted manner. She said she didn't want to get the shot but that chocolate always made it better. \"So let's have some chocolate then I said\". She got excited and said \"Okay, I'll go get some\". She came back with a chocolate cake and we used forks and ate right from the cake. Her actually getting the shot never enacted although the nurse was silently to the side of us watching and waiting, not creepily but just subtly there, almost not, as a dream figure. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nWe were eating the cake on a round wooden picnic table and many of our friends were with us at/around the table now too. Kristina was sitting on the table, I on its bench. We were talking and I remember me saying something worried and Kristina responded something like, \"but that's why you have me\" with a comforting/warm smile. I grabbed her arm just above elbow and leaned my head in a hug from the positioning of her on sitting upright on the table it made the hug positioned awkwardly like that but it didn't matter at that moment, the message was received. I remember thinking, \"maybe this time it's alright. Maybe this time I can just be here in this comfortable/safe/loving environment and everything was going to be okay.\" The dream ended and I awoke to cold, early reality, two thousand miles away. How did I get here?\n\n<br><br>\n",

      "body": "The first dream I remember from last night woke me from my sleep. Someone was explaining something to me in my dream and right when they said \"...and it happens on the number 13.\" I shot out of bed thinking it was 6:09am when I did which in my half asleep state I thought was related to 13 somehow and it freaked me out a little. One of my arms were completely numb when I popped out so that didn't help either. I used the rest room with my limp arm, getting it to wake up and then I went back to sleep. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nNow the earliest back in this next dream scene I remember (although I do remember it starting earlier), was walking into an old bowling alley type business on Main Street of a random an ol' town New Mexico style place. It was some type of bowling but not exactly. I was at the front desk which curved around in a long \"U\" shape where the two ends of the \"U\" met the wall of the facade of the building. An old white man with grey hair, maybe 80 or so was at the counter. There was some sort or verification/approval/paper process to allow us to enter the building and play the game that took a little time. After a few minutes three other guys joined the line native New Mexicans or the punk rocker type, all white and seemingly around my age. At first they didn't interact much but as we were approved and headed back to what was going to be like the locker room, we passed through some of the strangest architecture. Not like an alien style or anything, everything was still of the style of the old building just we walked through the strangest shaped doors and openings. Finally a very narrow opening. All the while each carrying a large bag of clothes (it was just him and I now, the dream rid his two friends). Through the narrow passage and down some equally small stairs we went into what looked like a furnished on room apartment. Of course everything was of the old/used style so the TV was a tube/analog one. It was on the basement level and there were small windows near the ceiling and where level with the sidewalk outside. I mentioned to him, man this place is trippy and he replied, I am tripping (like literally he was on drugs but he also thought the place was trippy). I turned to a darker cutout in the wall to put my stuff down. There were no lights on, just the light from the sidewalk windows but it was mid-day so everything was moderately lit. T dropped my bag in the dark cut out and like the Cheshire cat, Kristina was sitting in the cut out smiling with her hands on the floor by her sides leaning forward slightly. We exchanged some words, I don't know what exactly and then the scene changed.   \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI was back outside progressing further down the main street from the direction I had originated. I came to the end of Main Street where a empty dirt lot and a big tree grew. The kind that grow big and tall along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque with the small green leaves. Suddenly I came across the trio together there sitting in the sunny street, Katrina, Kristina and Kara. Completely chillaxed, enjoying the easy weather/breeze and the sun. We said 'hi' and exchanged words but I don't recall exactly. I remember saying something like \"oh it's you guys again, how nice.\" in a teasing/sarcastic way. I then went to lay in the opposite corner of the street, diagonally away from them as well, limbs fully stretched out and in the full sun (whereas they were in the full shade of the tree in the lot). I just laid there, trying to be even more chillax then they were while ignoring them a little. Of course they didn't care. Dylan H walked up on my side of the street and we exchanged some words that I forget. Scene change. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nWe were now fully down that street that was Main Street and it curved to the left and turned into houses instead of buildings along the street. I to one of the houses just where the curve ended. There were some college female students outside. I forget all the details, but it felt almost like a sorority but it wasn't, it was just someone's house that went to UNM and had some friends over. I guess what made it feel like a sorority or some official part of the college was there was a small fold-out table on the porch of the house where they were talking to people about something and then a mid-aged nurse showed up too for the college students to give some of shots. Then again Kristina, Kara and Katrina rolled up and got out. The nurse was making sure everyone had their shots and Kristina was dreading it because she knew she hadn't had hers yet. She said she hated doctor visits in a spaced out/distracted manner. She said she didn't want to get the shot but that chocolate always made it better. \"So let's have some chocolate then I said\". She got excited and said \"Okay, I'll go get some\". She came back with a chocolate cake and we used forks and ate right from the cake. Her actually getting the shot never enacted although the nurse was silently to the side of us watching and waiting, not creepily but just subtly there, almost not, as a dream figure. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nWe were eating the cake on a round wooden picnic table and many of our friends were with us at/around the table now too. Kristina was sitting on the table, I on its bench. We were talking and I remember me saying something worried and Kristina responded something like, \"but that's why you have me\" with a comforting/warm smile. I grabbed her arm just above elbow and leaned my head in a hug from the positioning of her on sitting upright on the table it made the hug positioned awkwardly like that but it didn't matter at that moment, the message was received. I remember thinking, \"maybe this time it's alright. Maybe this time I can just be here in this comfortable/safe/loving environment and everything was going to be okay.\" The dream ended and I awoke to cold, early reality, two thousand miles away. How did I get here?\n\n<br><br>",

These entries may help me understand why.\"'\n---\n\nEarliest I recall into the dream I was at my friend Daniel’s from Los Alamos except this time he lived in the island part of Big Rock Loop, about next to where Skip’s house was. I remember walking up a dirt driveway with a small outhouse before the house which the main house was the size of a double trailer (come to think of it, that part of Dan’s home was the same as our upstairs of our home in Tsikumu. We were in the living room area of my house and his and talking about something. Except there was a computer desktop desk against the sun facing wall where we were. It seemed in the dream he was always frowning and in a bad mood and cautious not to break any rules as his whole deminore was via the influence of his strict father. After hanging out like this for a few minutes we then went out to another outhouse in the front yard. From here we didn’t talk much, in fact Dan was outside much closer to the house than I was. I remember looking out from the house towards the neighbors and saw another friend from high school. I don’t recall his name. I remember he was looking sad and it was dark in his house. Not super dark but the lights weren’t on. He did lots of drugs and I had the impression from the dream that his dad wasn’t the nicest to him either. For a second seeing him sparked a thought/desire in my mind wondering when all the guys were going to get together that night and smoke and drink as per usual. Which is interesting to think now that that triggered that desire. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nThen Jimmy came over and Sabrina & Sara showed up shortly after. We were not hanging out in the originally described, smaller outhouse. Then Jimmy became a attractive blonde female (actually I don’t ever remember Jimmy being Jimmy in the dream at all), a 8.5 or 9 maybe. I remember thinking to myself that she was always just a really good friend but now after years being away and now that I was visiting again and older (older in my mind), I now suddenly found her attractive. I remember wanting to act on it somehow when all of a sudden there was a ruckus outside. Seems the neighbors, who was no longer the friend from high school from earlier, was upset about something we at Dan’s had done. Something that seemingly affected him but the exact thing was never made clear. So he backed his lawn mower onto the yard and unloaded a block of cut grass the dimensions of a sedan but only a third of the height. I remember I didn’t want to get Dan’s dad angry so I quickly and gracefully acted and began to clean up the grass. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nThen the dream changed and I was at my home in New Jersey and I was working on some device. I was using trial and error to try out a bunch of different pieces for whatever I was building. I don’t remember exactly, twas extremely vague. Suddenly Scout, my dog was outside and when I got outside he was walking quickly down the side of the street. He then checked for cars and crossed over. The dream didn’t show him coming back and I didn’t go after him but suddenly he was back in the house and I was in the sun room with him again when he jumped up on the screen dog and pressed the handle open with his nose. He was suddenly off and down the street again crossing. That was all I remember. \n",

I remember wanting to act on it somehow when all of a sudden there was a ruckus outside.

Something that seemingly affected him but the exact thing was never made clear.

I was using trial and error to try out a bunch of different pieces for whatever I was building. I don’t remember exactly, twas extremely vague. Suddenly Scout, my dog was outside and when I got outside he was walking quickly down the side of the street. He then checked for cars and crossed over. The dream didn’t show him coming back and I didn’t go after him but suddenly he was back in the house and I was in the sun room with him again when he jumped up on the screen dog and pressed the handle open with his nose.

The farthest back I remember I was walking through the second floor of a building with a revolver on a mission of sorts. I remember being with two others on my team, a guy and a girl (which I think may have even been Agent Dunham and Lee from Fringe, not exactly them, but versions of them). But then it was just me wondering around a hallway with all the lights on. No one else was there on the floor. I went back downstairs which was a co-ed locker room of a gym seemingly. The lockers were blue and the grown was grey as it was just concrete. I went to a locker to change my clothes. There was a woman attending her locker a few rows down. She wasn't particularly attractive, a 5 or 6, but I remember thinking to myself, \"I should be polite and start a conversation\". I believe she initiated a conversation and we had a friendly banter for a few minutes before leaving. I believe I met him before I got outside but there was a guy, maybe a couple years older than me, I didn't have a ride home so he offered to give me a lift. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nWe talked about a bunch of stuff but I don't recall details except for when we were outside at his truck I told him I was from New Mexico. Los Alamos, NM I remember saying it from a position of ego as Los Alamos is very much not a average place to be from. He didn't know where that was and so I fell back how I always do in that situation and explained it's where Los Alamos National Laboratory  is (no one usually knows what LANL is either so in the same line I have to include), where they built the atomic bomb. He didn't reply, didn't seem to care and was already thinking about something else. Suddenly he went from being just a friendly guy to exhibiting attraction towards me. I remember feeling unfortune and now having to deal with the change of events. We talked a little bit more outside and then went back inside to order a meal as the ground floor had now become a diner. I remember us going up to be seated and then suddenly I was but just me. The waiter came and I asked what happened to the person I walked in with and he explained how I had slipped away from him and sat myself here suddenly when he wasn't looking.

I climbed to the top of one of the main pyramid’s with one of the uncles and when I got there lightning started to strike the flat top of the pyramid and we could see from where we were past some trees to a smaller stone structure that could be described as the shape of the frame of a hour glass only four or so stories high and made of stone. When the lightning hit it, it was captured inside where the sand of the hour glass would be. It started to glow a bright blue light and pulsated a little. I remember pointing it out to the uncle and being in awe, puzzled and grateful all at the same time to have seen it. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe second act of this dream I was driving in an old van with my friend Najee into the city of Chicago where he lived. We were going under a curved exit similar to one in Trenton and after a few minutes of driving we were at one of his family member’s homes. The van had broken down so we pulled in and parked outside the apartment complex with was right up to the sidewalk and Najee popped the hood. Under the hood the car was rather plain. Twas just mainly to rods sticking out of a plastic floor/frame where the engine usually is. Two steel metal rods, about a foot in length and 2 inches in width and with grooves like a screw. There was also some wiring going to the top of these and two smaller rods, only about 4 inches and then a box in the upper left that was probably the battery and a similar sized circuit/fuse box in the bottom right corner. The fuse box was designed for just two large fuses that had connectors on both ends. We tried removing one and starting the car, and re-inserting it and starting the car. We also unscrewed the two large rods from the car and then re-interested them. This was the end of what I recall.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAug 10th 2013,\nI remember being in a gym back in high-school. There was a group of kids that were outcasted and not treated as they should have been with respect. I went up to one of the guys who was a nice guy and started to explain to him that all he had to do to change was work out. I then went to explain how easy working out really was, “You just lift up and down and that’s it!”. I felt sorry for this crowd and thought that I could pick this one guy, pal up with him and get him muscular. While this wouldn’t guarantee acceptance, it would at least gain some respect points and at the same time make it nicer for the ladies in his life and is healthy all at the same time. We went to some small party together and instead of me leading him in a workout, he led me on some path that was very Alice-in-Wonderlandesque. We entered some sewer tunnels and then suddenly some of the tunnels were only the size of a silver dollar. I stopped before entering as it was too small to enter but he seemed to think this was the path we were taking. He simply leaned into the pipe head first and through the pipe he disappeared. I love adventures so I promptly did the same with little hesitation. Head first and it became like a twisting and turning water slide. We popped though a few of these and that was the end of this dream-act. \n\n<br><br>\n\nI was now back in Los Alamos in a separate instance of reality than the previous dream act. One that was closer to real-life reality. I was visiting Los Alamos. I remember being there for a few days staying somewhere by myself. I hung out with a few friends maybe three days for a couple hours each time over a week’s time (this didn’t enact, twas merely implied). I remember thinking, “Kristina’s really ignoring the fact that I’m here visiting.” When suddenly I was on a jog from Big Rock Loop towards the round-about and I was almost there when I saw Kristina coming down the road. She was holding on with her left arm to a truck as she jogged with it down the road. Blissfully as always, she said hi with a big genuine smile. We talked a little (although it didn’t enact) and she let go of the truck and we kept jogging into the trail at the round-about. Suddenly she was on a bike. She had explained to me that she was doing some sort of workouts that used only bikes to get around which involved many BMX maneuvers. Right off the road into the trail wasn’t like it was in real life. The forest was extremely thick and a tree had fallen in front of the trail. I remember thinking in my mind the BMX maneuver she could have used to traverse the log but after a moment she was off the bike and with her back on the ground, squeezing under the log (the forest was really really thick I’m telling you so this didn’t seem entirely not logical). It was a tight squeeze under the log and she got dirt all over her shirt and scraped against the log but didn’t think of it for a second. She was going to get past the log and she did, dirt or no dirt, mission accomplished. I paused in this moment and realized this was a big source of my love for this girl. Never in my life have I met a woman that would do that in a moment’s notice and not think a thing of it, let alone a woman that attractive. She is the only such I’ve met so far that is a true lady and half mountain goat at the same time. This was the end of what I remember of the dream-act.  \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAug 11th 2013,\nI remember I was visiting New Mexico in the current year, 2013 in a reality close to our real-life one. There was a scene of me driving with Sophia in Albuquerque headed somewhere to meet with family. A scene Sanjam and others were in a cafeteria of sorts. I pointed out Steve & Stu were there down a few rows and a couple other people from NJ and said this would be a nice place for us all to take some time off. There was a dream of me playing a cheaper version of grand theft auto. It reminded me of my Die Hard game for Sega Saturn a little actually except with cars and I was duel wielding two shot guns at one point. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIn the final scene I was in Los Alamos, presumably at Gabe’s house although Gabe wasn’t there. It was his father Bill and some family friends that went without recognizable identities. I remember in the prior scene looking at a web design magazine and seeing all the cool apps people were coming out with. Now in this act Bill was looking at the same magazine and saying something along the lines of “Oh if I was young in this age”, implying that he would have loved to be young in this time and to be creative with app making and make money from it at the same time. This was all I remember from this dream-act. \n\n<br><br>",
      "content": "I’ve missed the last three days in dreams so here is a shorter summer of each.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAug 9th 2013,<br>\n I dreamt I was on vacation visiting the Mayan Pyramids with some family friend’s family. I climbed to the top of one of the main pyramid’s with one of the uncles and when I got there lightning started to strike the flat top of the pyramid and we could see from where we were past some trees to a smaller stone structure that could be described as the shape of the frame of a hour glass only four or so stories high and made of stone. When the lightning hit it, it was captured inside where the sand of the hour glass would be. It started to glow a bright blue light and pulsated a little. I remember pointing it out to the uncle and being in awe, puzzled and grateful all at the same time to have seen it. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe second act of this dream I was driving in an old van with my friend Najee into the city of Chicago where he lived. We were going under a curved exit similar to one in Trenton and after a few minutes of driving we were at one of his family member’s homes. The van had broken down so we pulled in and parked outside the apartment complex with was right up to the sidewalk and Najee popped the hood. Under the hood the car was rather plain. Twas just mainly to rods sticking out of a plastic floor/frame where the engine usually is. Two steel metal rods, about a foot in length and 2 inches in width and with grooves like a screw. There was also some wiring going to the top of these and two smaller rods, only about 4 inches and then a box in the upper left that was probably the battery and a similar sized circuit/fuse box in the bottom right corner. The fuse box was designed for just two large fuses that had connectors on both ends. We tried removing one and starting the car, and re-inserting it and starting the car. We also unscrewed the two large rods from the car and then re-interested them. This was the end of what I recall.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAug 10th 2013,\nI remember being in a gym back in high-school. There was a group of kids that were outcasted and not treated as they should have been with respect. I went up to one of the guys who was a nice guy and started to explain to him that all he had to do to change was work out. I then went to explain how easy working out really was, “You just lift up and down and that’s it!”. I felt sorry for this crowd and thought that I could pick this one guy, pal up with him and get him muscular. While this wouldn’t guarantee acceptance, it would at least gain some respect points and at the same time make it nicer for the ladies in his life and is healthy all at the same time. We went to some small party together and instead of me leading him in a workout, he led me on some path that was very Alice-in-Wonderlandesque. We entered some sewer tunnels and then suddenly some of the tunnels were only the size of a silver dollar. I stopped before entering as it was too small to enter but he seemed to think this was the path we were taking. He simply leaned into the pipe head first and through the pipe he disappeared. I love adventures so I promptly did the same with little hesitation. Head first and it became like a twisting and turning water slide. We popped though a few of these and that was the end of this dream-act. \n\n<br><br>\n\nI was now back in Los Alamos in a separate instance of reality than the previous dream act. One that was closer to real-life reality. I was visiting Los Alamos. I remember being there for a few days staying somewhere by myself. I hung out with a few friends maybe three days for a couple hours each time over a week’s time (this didn’t enact, twas merely implied). I remember thinking, “Kristina’s really ignoring the fact that I’m here visiting.” When suddenly I was on a jog from Big Rock Loop towards the round-about and I was almost there when I saw Kristina coming down the road.

      "contentRenderedWithoutLayouts": "I’ve missed the last three days in dreams so here is a shorter summer of each.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAug 9th 2013,<br>\n I dreamt I was on vacation visiting the Mayan Pyramids with some family friend’s family. I climbed to the top of one of the main pyramid’s with one of the uncles and when I got there lightning started to strike the flat top of the pyramid and we could see from where we were past some trees to a smaller stone structure that could be described as the shape of the frame of a hour glass only four or so stories high and made of stone. When the lightning hit it, it was captured inside where the sand of the hour glass would be. It started to glow a bright blue light and pulsated a little. I remember pointing it out to the uncle and being in awe, puzzled and grateful all at the same time to have seen it. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe second act of this dream I was driving in an old van with my friend Najee into the city of Chicago where he lived. We were going under a curved exit similar to one in Trenton and after a few minutes of driving we were at one of his family member’s homes. The van had broken down so we pulled in and parked outside the apartment complex with was right up to the sidewalk and Najee popped the hood. Under the hood the car was rather plain. Twas just mainly to rods sticking out of a plastic floor/frame where the engine usually is. Two steel metal rods, about a foot in length and 2 inches in width and with grooves like a screw. There was also some wiring going to the top of these and two smaller rods, only about 4 inches and then a box in the upper left that was probably the battery and a similar sized circuit/fuse box in the bottom right corner. The fuse box was designed for just two large fuses that had connectors on both ends. We tried removing one and starting the car, and re-inserting it and starting the car. We also unscrewed the two large rods from the car and then re-interested them. This was the end of what I recall.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAug 10th 2013,\nI remember being in a gym back in high-school. There was a group of kids that were outcasted and not treated as they should have been with respect. I went up to one of the guys who was a nice guy and started to explain to him that all he had to do to change was work out. I then went to explain how easy working out really was, “You just lift up and down and that’s it!”. I felt sorry for this crowd and thought that I could pick this one guy, pal up with him and get him muscular. While this wouldn’t guarantee acceptance, it would at least gain some respect points and at the same time make it nicer for the ladies in his life and is healthy all at the same time. We went to some small party together and instead of me leading him in a workout, he led me on some path that was very Alice-in-Wonderlandesque. We entered some sewer tunnels and then suddenly some of the tunnels were only the size of a silver dollar. I stopped before entering as it was too small to enter but he seemed to think this was the path we were taking. He simply leaned into the pipe head first and through the pipe he disappeared. I love adventures so I promptly did the same with little hesitation. Head first and it became like a twisting and turning water slide. We popped though a few of these and that was the end of this dream-act. \n\n<br><br>\n\nI was now back in Los Alamos in a separate instance of reality than the previous dream act. One that was closer to real-life reality. I was visiting Los Alamos. I remember being there for a few days staying somewhere by myself. I hung out with a few friends maybe three days for a couple hours each time over a week’s time (this didn’t enact, twas merely implied). I remember thinking, “Kristina’s really ignoring the fact that I’m here visiting.” When suddenly I was on a jog from Big Rock Loop towards the round-about and I was almost there when I saw Kristina coming down the road. She was holding on with her left arm to a truck as she jogged with it down the road. Blissfully as always, she said hi with a big genuine smile. We talked a little (although it didn’t enact) and she let go of the truck and we kept jogging into the trail at the round-about. Suddenly she was on a bike. She had explained to me that she was doing some sort of workouts that used only bikes to get around which involved many BMX maneuvers. Right off the road into the trail wasn’t like it was in real life. The forest was extremely thick and a tree had fallen in front of the trail. I remember thinking in my mind the BMX maneuver she could have used to traverse the log but after a moment she was off the bike and with her back on the ground, squeezing under the log (the forest was really really thick I’m telling you so this didn’t seem entirely not logical). It was a tight squeeze under the log and she got dirt all over her shirt and scraped against the log but didn’t think of it for a second. She was going to get past the log and she did, dirt or no dirt, mission accomplished. I paused in this moment and realized this was a big source of my love for this girl. Never in my life have I met a woman that would do that in a moment’s notice and not think a thing of it, let alone a woman that attractive. She is the only such I’ve met so far that is a true lady and half mountain goat at the same time. This was the end of what I remember of the dream-act.  \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAug 11th 2013,\nI remember I was visiting New Mexico in the current year, 2013 in a reality close to our real-life one. There was a scene of me driving with Sophia in Albuquerque headed somewhere to meet with family. A scene Sanjam and others were in a cafeteria of sorts. I pointed out Steve & Stu were there down a few rows and a couple other people from NJ and said this would be a nice place for us all to take some time off. There was a dream of me playing a cheaper version of grand theft auto. It reminded me of my Die Hard game for Sega Saturn a little actually except with cars and I was duel wielding two shot guns at one point. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIn the final scene I was in Los Alamos, presumably at Gabe’s house although Gabe wasn’t there. It was his father Bill and some family friends that went without recognizable identities. I remember in the prior scene looking at a web design magazine and seeing all the cool apps people were coming out with. Now in this act Bill was looking at the same magazine and saying something along the lines of “Oh if I was young in this age”, implying that he would have loved to be young in this time and to be creative with app making and make money from it at the same time. This was all I remember from this dream-act. \n\n<br><br>",

I was with Zach M and we found a empty house that resembled mine in Tsikamo. We entered and began scavaging for things when K her sister and mom came home. We were glad to see them and re-grouped a little. Shortly after that K's dad came home. I don't remember him saying hi but Zach had begun taking apart the flat screen tv in the master bedroom and he pointed that out to us in a stern way. Before he could tell us what to do Zach had it back together. \n\n<br><br>\n\nI went outside and remember looking around at the mountains and feeling the warm breeze thinking that this zombie thing really made for a peaceful world. K came out shortly after. We talked for a little and then an encouter occured but was short lived. More of just a kind gesture on her behalf. Feeling pitty I assume. Or at least it ended with those ideas but that's not how it started. That's all I recall of the zombie scene. \n\n<br><br>\n\nActaully I'm probably missing a transition here but next I recall being on a school bus headed for high-school. I was a few seats behind the middle of the bus on the left side and K and Matt S were a few seats ahead of me on the left side. K was more friendly and into Matt than he was. She was being her normal bubbly awesome self. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIt was the first day of senior year. I skated around the school, not knowing where any of my classes were (this is a incident that happened in real life, both the skateboarding through school(a couple times), and the first day without getting my class papers till the bell rang although the two events on different occations). The first bell rang and I finally found a faculty office facade counter where students were lined up to get their class schedules and locker numbers ect... Shawn C was in line behind me. Was good to see him again. I got my class papers and my first class was called illuminati. I didn't pick the class and I remember wondering how it got there. I wondered the hall ways clueless and came across a classroom who's facade was elaborate greek and cathedral-like design. The room had no number and had a couple doors into it. I figured this matched the style for a class like this so I entered a door that was already slightly open. There was a large projector screen. The room coud have almost been two stories. The walls all held books like a library and everything was custom and ornate except the tile floor and desks. I walked straight in, not looking at anyone and found a desk to the right of the room which was the closest path to a desk from the door I enetered. The desks were all in a semi-circle around the projector and teacher. The teacher addressed me asking if I like being late and I settled still with my skateboard in my hands. I said \"Well Ye... No\". I started to answer yes but the room was stern, no room for class clowns in this sanctuary of learning. \n\n<br><br>\n\nWe were learning the historical events on video. Then K and Matt were there in a desk in front of me suddenly. K was answering the teach with a story about a little boy she was looking over at work. \"...and the boy just wouldn't kiss me\" as she sighed and leaned he her on Matt's chest. She said this as if this little boy not giving her a kiss on the cheek was improbable, but saying it in a manner that she was not obviously actually distressed, but more so playfully distressed. \"... and then I finished the story and he gave me a kiss finally\" not those exact words, but something similar. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIt's been 7 years with K as a consistent dream character and in last night's dream she was in every scene. Quite persistent. What is this about? My conscience sentimental feelings for her other than caring for her like a sister are all but gone. I rarely think of her now and never even frequently in the past that I recall. Maybe it's from watching Ghost in the Shell and the character the Major, how she's always confident in herself and independent, noble, rightious, humorous/joking and of course physically attractive. But could that alone arise such a dream? Why didn't I just dream of the Major then? How deep is this in my subconscience and why? \n\n<br><br>\n\nTo be a human, alas. \n\n<br>\n",

[Dream Journal Sept 24th 2013]</h1>\n\t<div class=\"post-content\">The earliest back in my dreams last night I remember a zombie scene back in Los Alamos. I was with Zach M and we found a empty house that resembled mine in Tsikamo. We entered and began scavaging for things when K her sister and mom came home. We were glad to see them and re-grouped a little. Shortly after that K's dad came home. I don't remember him saying hi but Zach had begun taking apart the flat screen tv in the master bedroom and he pointed that out to us in a stern way. Before he could tell us what to do Zach had it back together. \n\n<br><br>\n\nI went outside and remember looking around at the mountains and feeling the warm breeze thinking that this zombie thing really made for a peaceful world. K came out shortly after. We talked for a little and then an encouter occured but was short lived. More of just a kind gesture on her behalf. Feeling pitty I assume. Or at least it ended with those ideas but that's not how it started. That's all I recall of the zombie scene. \n\n<br><br>\n\nActaully I'm probably missing a transition here but next I recall being on a school bus headed for high-school. I was a few seats behind the middle of the bus on the left side and K and Matt S were a few seats ahead of me on the left side. K was more friendly and into Matt than he was. She was being her normal bubbly awesome self. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIt was the first day of senior year. I skated around the school, not knowing where any of my classes were (this is a incident that happened in real life, both the skateboarding through school(a couple times), and the first day without getting my class papers till the bell rang although the two events on different occations). The first bell rang and I finally found a faculty office facade counter where students were lined up to get their class schedules and locker numbers ect... Shawn C was in line behind me. Was good to see him again. I got my class papers and my first class was called illuminati. I didn't pick the class and I remember wondering how it got there. I wondered the hall ways clueless and came across a classroom who's facade was elaborate greek and cathedral-like design. The room had no number and had a couple doors into it. I figured this matched the style for a class like this so I entered a door that was already slightly open. There was a large projector screen. The room coud have almost been two stories. The walls all held books like a library and everything was custom and ornate except the tile floor and desks. I walked straight in, not looking at anyone and found a desk to the right of the room which was the closest path to a desk from the door I enetered. The desks were all in a semi-circle around the projector and teacher. The teacher addressed me asking if I like being late and I settled still with my skateboard in my hands. I said \"Well Ye... No\". I started to answer yes but the room was stern, no room for class clowns in this sanctuary of learning. \n\n<br><br>\n\nWe were learning the historical events on video. Then K and Matt were there in a desk in front of me suddenly. K was answering the teach with a story about a little boy she was looking over at work. \"...and the boy just wouldn't kiss me\" as she sighed and leaned he her on Matt's chest. She said this as if this little boy not giving her a kiss on the cheek was improbable, but saying it in a manner that she was not obviously actually distressed, but more so playfully distressed. \"... and then I finished the story and he gave me a kiss finally\" not those exact words, but something similar. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIt's been 7 years with K as a consistent dream character and in last night's dream she was in every scene. Quite persistent. What is this about? My conscience sentimental feelings for her other than caring for her like a sister are all but gone. I rarely think of her now and never even frequently in the past that I recall. Maybe it's from watching Ghost in the Shell and the character the Major, how she's always confident in herself and independent, noble, rightious, humorous/joking and of course physically attractive. But could that alone arise such a dream? Why didn't I just dream of the Major then? How deep is this in my subconscience and why? \n\n<br><br>\n\nTo be a human, alas. \n\n<br></div>\n</article>\n\n<footer>\n\t\n</footer>\n\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"footer pure-u-1\">\n\t\t&copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ <a href=\"https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us\" target=\"_blank\"><!-- iconmonstr START --><svg id=\"os\" class=\"os\" rel=\"tipsy\" data-placement=\"above\" data-content=\"Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com & hosted via Github Pages.

Unfortunately I didn't log this right when I got out of bed but the farthest back I do remember is still significant. I was driving into NYC to some specific location for a meeting or event of sorts. It felt like it could have been business in nature. I remember getting lost and driving through some neighborhoods that were semi-sketchy but not too bad. I considered pulling over and figuring out where to go but didn't. I seemingly wasn't using a GPS. I remember leaving the neighborhood and getting back ore on a highway-like road. I remember driving through an overlapping intersection and feeling like I missed the correct forked exit. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI finally got to where I was going, some building that was closed/locked but I had a way prepared/known way in. Once inside I met up with a girl. Seems the event was actually a rendezvous with this girl. We were walking down the hallway of an office-like building, plain with carpeted floors. We got to the end of the hallway and a door on the left where we knew was locked and had a shipment of some sort of goods that we worked with together in our day-job (the context/feeling was that we didn't normally work in this building during out day job though). Suddenly we could hear someone coming. They were with someone or talking on the phone to someone. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nShe got excited and used the opportunity to ploy me into picking the lock (picking the lock may have come from seeing all the lock picking in Fringe) to sneak into the storage room, which really wasn't much of a storage room more so than an empty office with a few boxes cardboard inside. I remember we opened one of the boxes with my Swiss army knife but the contents where never shown or used in the dream. After almost 30 minutes or so of just sitting on the floor talking, doing nothing, we were not talking and it was time to do something. We had obviously met here secretly for a reason and it was time to make a move. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI was really shy about it as expected and didn't know how to gracefully initiate. So instead I just imagined in my mind what to do, but I was in a dream so that thinking in my mind manifested into the actual dream and suddenly we were naked and in the act. I don't remember all the details but I remember it was passionate and in the moment. We experimented with different things and had a good time. I won't describe the details as to remain PG but the reason this is significant as stated above it because sexual acts are 99.99999999% never actually enacted in my dreams. I always attributed this to the fact that there is sparse sexual activity in my real life and therefore nothing to go off of but if my mind brings events from Fringe, which I've been watching nightly, then why would it enact sex as I do watch porn every now and then (not for the duration that I watch Fringe but watched regardless). \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAnd so now I hypothesize that this sexual enactment is the result of me journaling that it wasn't enacted just the previous dream entry and this stimulated or sponsored it occurring last night. This could be very significant indeed and in that case I still need to remember more of my dream scenes and to be much more lucid in my dreams. Request away to the back of my brain and to the cosmos! My answers await.\n",

[Dream Journal Aug 3rd 2013]</h1>\n\t<div class=\"post-content\">This time I wasn't back in high school in my dream and I was back on the East Coast, not Los Alamos. Unfortunately I didn't log this right when I got out of bed but the farthest back I do remember is still significant. I was driving into NYC to some specific location for a meeting or event of sorts. It felt like it could have been business in nature. I remember getting lost and driving through some neighborhoods that were semi-sketchy but not too bad. I considered pulling over and figuring out where to go but didn't. I seemingly wasn't using a GPS. I remember leaving the neighborhood and getting back ore on a highway-like road. I remember driving through an overlapping intersection and feeling like I missed the correct forked exit. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI finally got to where I was going, some building that was closed/locked but I had a way prepared/known way in. Once inside I met up with a girl. Seems the event was actually a rendezvous with this girl. We were walking down the hallway of an office-like building, plain with carpeted floors. We got to the end of the hallway and a door on the left where we knew was locked and had a shipment of some sort of goods that we worked with together in our day-job (the context/feeling was that we didn't normally work in this building during out day job though). Suddenly we could hear someone coming. They were with someone or talking on the phone to someone. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nShe got excited and used the opportunity to ploy me into picking the lock (picking the lock may have come from seeing all the lock picking in Fringe) to sneak into the storage room, which really wasn't much of a storage room more so than an empty office with a few boxes cardboard inside. I remember we opened one of the boxes with my Swiss army knife but the contents where never shown or used in the dream. After almost 30 minutes or so of just sitting on the floor talking, doing nothing, we were not talking and it was time to do something. We had obviously met here secretly for a reason and it was time to make a move. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nI was really shy about it as expected and didn't know how to gracefully initiate. So instead I just imagined in my mind what to do, but I was in a dream so that thinking in my mind manifested into the actual dream and suddenly we were naked and in the act. I don't remember all the details but I remember it was passionate and in the moment. We experimented with different things and had a good time. I won't describe the details as to remain PG but the reason this is significant as stated above it because sexual acts are 99.99999999% never actually enacted in my dreams. I always attributed this to the fact that there is sparse sexual activity in my real life and therefore nothing to go off of but if my mind brings events from Fringe, which I've been watching nightly, then why would it enact sex as I do watch porn every now and then (not for the duration that I watch Fringe but watched regardless). \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAnd so now I hypothesize that this sexual enactment is the result of me journaling that it wasn't enacted just the previous dream entry and this stimulated or sponsored it occurring last night. This could be very significant indeed and in that case I still need to remember more of my dream scenes and to be much more lucid in my dreams. Request away to the back of my brain and to the cosmos!

A teacher was there helping us. At some point, not sure if it was at this point or later but Caroline from Chairlift became the teacher with bright blonde but seemingly natural with 3 inches or so towards the end, ending in her natural brown hair color. I remember specifically how vivid and natural her hair looked and a very clean/clear parting of her hair in the back (If you can't tell by now, #fyi I have a huge crush on Caroline). We worked there for a while and I remember thinking how nice it was for the teacher to stay after school and help me. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAfter we all piled in a car and drove to a friend’s house with the teacher as the driver. We got there and first hung out up stairs for a while playing a computer game I was for a few minutes I believe with one of the kids that lived there. They had a big family, probably 5 kids, cats and dogs and the house was a little messy but not the worst. Then we went down stairs where they had a pool and a walk out basement (this was very similar in dimension to our old house in Los Alamos actually where my dad build our house with a similar walk out basement). I remember my cousin Andre was there and dived in the pool head first. I remember following after him trying to dive head first with my hands in front of me, but it didn't work and I more so belly flopped (I've never dove head first into water before in my life I don't think and I remember vaguely being at a pool after having too much to drink, diving off the diving board and flopping similarly). \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAfter my attempted dive I wasn't that far into the water but I put my feet against the edge of the pool and pushed deeper down. Then my feet were on the bottom and I continued to push around. Andre was swimming around underwater too. Then I got out and walked around the edge of the pool for a little. There was a row of desks and computers against the walk out face and again I went to watch one of the kids play a game. When I was down I looked back and the pool was empty. They had left me there. I remember feeling awkward at their home being left there and slightly let down and degraded. I believe I began walking home and then called my mom and let her know what had happened. And for some reason in the call I explained to her that part of the reason I had no ride back was because Gabe and I bought a fish. \n\nI do remember asking one character in my dream about something and he gave a definite answer. I always have a sub-awareness that I’m in a dream when I am and I believe I remember even asking him, if he was sure and he was. His answer felt external. He had a handlebar mustache. I remember receiving one other definite answer in the dream but I think it was of something of no consequence and may have had to do with fish or something similar again. \n",

A teacher was there helping us. At some point, not sure if it was at this point or later but Caroline from Chairlift became the teacher with bright blonde but seemingly natural with 3 inches or so towards the end, ending in her natural brown hair color. I remember specifically how vivid and natural her hair looked and a very clean/clear parting of her hair in the back (If you can't tell by now, #fyi I have a huge crush on Caroline). We worked there for a while and I remember thinking how nice it was for the teacher to stay after school and help me. \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAfter we all piled in a car and drove to a friend’s house with the teacher as the driver. We got there and first hung out up stairs for a while playing a computer game I was for a few minutes I believe with one of the kids that lived there. They had a big family, probably 5 kids, cats and dogs and the house was a little messy but not the worst. Then we went down stairs where they had a pool and a walk out basement (this was very similar in dimension to our old house in Los Alamos actually where my dad build our house with a similar walk out basement). I remember my cousin Andre was there and dived in the pool head first. I remember following after him trying to dive head first with my hands in front of me, but it didn't work and I more so belly flopped (I've never dove head first into water before in my life I don't think and I remember vaguely being at a pool after having too much to drink, diving off the diving board and flopping similarly). \n\n<br><br><br>\n\nAfter my attempted dive I wasn't that far into the water but I put my feet against the edge of the pool and pushed deeper down. Then my feet were on the bottom and I continued to push around. Andre was swimming around underwater too. Then I got out and walked around the edge of the pool for a little. There was a row of desks and computers against the walk out face and again I went to watch one of the kids play a game. When I was down I looked back and the pool was empty. They had left me there. I remember feeling awkward at their home being left there and slightly let down and degraded. I believe I began walking home and then called my mom and let her know what had happened. And for some reason in the call I explained to her that part of the reason I had no ride back was because Gabe and I bought a fish. \n\nI do remember asking one character in my dream about something and he gave a definite answer. I always have a sub-awareness that I’m in a dream when I am and I believe I remember even asking him, if he was sure and he was. His answer felt external. He had a handlebar mustache. I remember receiving one other definite answer in the dream but I think it was of something of no consequence and may have had to do with fish or something similar again.</div>\n</article>\n\n<footer>\n\t\n</footer>\n\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"footer pure-u-1\">\n\t\t&copy; Mikeum.us 2014.\n\t\tlast updated at 2014-10-01T21:08:09.040Z _ <a href=\"https://github.com/mikeumus/mikeum.us\" target=\"_blank\"><!-- iconmonstr START --><svg id=\"os\" class=\"os\" rel=\"tipsy\" data-placement=\"above\" data-content=\"Mikeum.us is open-source on Github.com & hosted via Github Pages.

They are still “languages” and there are multiple languages used in getting your idea online.

You build a house there for me and when it sells, I’ll give you 10%!” Sounds… bad.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd this is how it sounds when your looking for a developer for your startup: <strong>“Hey I’ve got this great app idea. You code it for me and I’ll give you 10%.”</strong> Maybe, if it ever turns into anything, but you're up against 9/10 odds for your business' success. The point is, when you break it down to that simple form, it’s weak. It’s a bad deal on the developer’s side. Sure there are more developers now than ever but there are still not enough. This is why Mark Zuckerberg has teamed with Bill Gates and others to make <a href=\"http://code.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Code.org</a>, because they (Mark &amp; Bill) don’t have enough coders for their own growing businesses (Facebook &amp; Microsoft) in a growing industry. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThere are countless IT recruitment businesses. I can’t believe so many are in business it’s boggling to me. They are aggressive. They find talent and have them in their client’s office in a week or two and these jobs pay really well. If you want to find a quality developer off the streets to sit at your house and code for you, you're facing some steep competition and money.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBack in the 90s, to have your own business was a very serious thing. The stigma back then was that you needed to go in with a hundred thousand or two and have all your ducks in a nice need row before you had any chance of maybe succeeding. Now the stigma has and is changing in our ever technologically advancing world towards anyone with an app idea feeling entitled to have that chance at becoming a iApp millionaire. Hopefully, younger developers and entrepreneurs won’t look back on this article in the near future (next 3 years maybe), when developing software for machines &amp; devices is literally as simple/intuitive as stacking lego blocks and think that I was just a bitter old man, mouthing off in his own little blog post.

The good news we have a system in place here at BetaBulls to get your app idea online. We are lucky enough to already have a sturdy team of developers to bring your idea to life.

This is why Mark Zuckerberg has teamed with Bill Gates and others to make <a href=\"http://code.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Code.org</a>, because they (Mark &amp; Bill) don’t have enough coders for their own growing businesses (Facebook &amp; Microsoft) in a growing industry. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThere are countless IT recruitment businesses. I can’t believe so many are in business it’s boggling to me. They are aggressive. They find talent and have them in their client’s office in a week or two and these jobs pay really well. If you want to find a quality developer off the streets to sit at your house and code for you, you're facing some steep competition and money.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBack in the 90s, to have your own business was a very serious thing. The stigma back then was that you needed to go in with a hundred thousand or two and have all your ducks in a nice need row before you had any chance of maybe succeeding. Now the stigma has and is changing in our ever technologically advancing world towards anyone with an app idea feeling entitled to have that chance at becoming a iApp millionaire. Hopefully, younger developers and entrepreneurs won’t look back on this article in the near future (next 3 years maybe), when developing software for machines &amp; devices is literally as simple/intuitive as stacking lego blocks and think that I was just a bitter old man, mouthing off in his own little blog post. I hope instead it reflects how I’m feeling in the present, just before lego block coding but facing an oncoming sea of startup ideas and the stigma that each is great and deserves a developer to code their idea. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI hope this article wasn’t too harsh. The good news we have a system in place here at BetaBulls to get your app idea online. We are lucky enough to already have a sturdy team of developers to bring your idea to life. We’re an idea factory. We make apps all day. If you're set on finding a lone developer for your startup, then please, don’t be discouraged by my writing above. They are out there and there are more and more everyday, but if you look and look and look and simply can’t find, remember that we’ll still be here waiting and ready to upstart your awesome app idea. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<u>Sincerely</u>, <br/>\n<i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mikeum.us/\">Michael Duane Mooring</a></i>\n<br/>",
