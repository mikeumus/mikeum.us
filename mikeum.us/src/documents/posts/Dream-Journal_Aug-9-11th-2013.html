I’ve missed the last three days in dreams so here is a shorter summer of each.

<br><br>

Aug 9th 2013,<br>
 I dreamt I was on vacation visiting the Mayan Pyramids with some family friend’s family. I climbed to the top of one of the main pyramid’s with one of the uncles and when I got there lightning started to strike the flat top of the pyramid and we could see from where we were past some trees to a smaller stone structure that could be described as the shape of the frame of a hour glass only four or so stories high and made of stone. When the lightning hit it, it was captured inside where the sand of the hour glass would be. It started to glow a bright blue light and pulsated a little. I remember pointing it out to the uncle and being in awe, puzzled and grateful all at the same time to have seen it.

The second act of this dream I was driving in an old van with my friend Najee into the city of Chicago where he lived. We were going under a curved exit similar to one in Trenton and after a few minutes of driving we were at one of his family member’s homes. The van had broken down so we pulled in and parked outside the apartment complex with was right up to the sidewalk and Najee popped the hood. Under the hood the car was rather plain. Twas just mainly to rods sticking out of a plastic floor/frame where the engine usually is. Two steel metal rods, about a foot in length and 2 inches in width and with grooves like a screw. There was also some wiring going to the top of these and two smaller rods, only about 4 inches and then a box in the upper left that was probably the battery and a similar sized circuit/fuse box in the bottom right corner. The fuse box was designed for just two large fuses that had connectors on both ends. We tried removing one and starting the car, and re-inserting it and starting the car. We also unscrewed the two large rods from the car and then re-interested them. This was the end of what I recall.

Aug 10th 2013,
I remember being in a gym back in high-school. There was a group of kids that were outcasted and not treated as they should have been with respect. I went up to one of the guys who was a nice guy and started to explain to him that all he had to do to change was work out. I then went to explain how easy working out really was, “You just lift up and down and that’s it!”. I felt sorry for this crowd and thought that I could pick this one guy, pal up with him and get him muscular. While this wouldn’t guarantee acceptance, it would at least gain some respect points and at the same time make it nicer for the ladies in his life and is healthy all at the same time. We went to some small party together and instead of me leading him in a workout, he led me on some path that was very Alice-in-Wonderlandesque. We entered some sewer tunnels and then suddenly some of the tunnels were only the size of a silver dollar. I stopped before entering as it was too small to enter but he seemed to think this was the path we were taking. He simply leaned into the pipe head first and through the pipe he disappeared. I love adventures so I promptly did the same with little hesitation. Head first and it became like a twisting and turning water slide. We popped though a few of these and that was the end of this dream-act.

I was now back in Los Alamos in a separate instance of reality than the previous dream act. One that was closer to real-life reality. I was visiting Los Alamos. I remember being there for a few days staying somewhere by myself. I hung out with a few friends maybe three days for a couple hours each time over a week’s time (this didn’t enact, twas merely implied). I remember thinking, “Kristina’s really ignoring the fact that I’m here visiting.” When suddenly I was on a jog from Big Rock Loop towards the round-about and I was almost there when I saw Kristina coming down the road. She was holding on with her left arm to a truck as she jogged with it down the road. Blissfully as always, she said hi with a big genuine smile. We talked a little (although it didn’t enact) and she let go of the truck and we kept jogging into the trail at the round-about. Suddenly she was on a bike. She had explained to me that she was doing some sort of workouts that used only bikes to get around which involved many BMX maneuvers. Right off the road into the trail wasn’t like it was in real life. The forest was extremely thick and a tree had fallen in front of the trail. I remember thinking in my mind the BMX maneuver she could have used to traverse the log but after a moment she was off the bike and with her back on the ground, squeezing under the log (the forest was really really thick I’m telling you so this didn’t seem entirely not logical). It was a tight squeeze under the log and she got dirt all over her shirt and scraped against the log but didn’t think of it for a second. She was going to get past the log and she did, dirt or no dirt, mission accomplished. I paused in this moment and realized this was a big source of my love for this girl. Never in my life have I met a woman that would do that in a moment’s notice and not think a thing of it, let alone a woman that attractive. She is the only such I’ve met so far that is a true lady and half mountain goat at the same time. This was the end of what I remember of the dream-act.

Aug 11th 2013,
I remember I was visiting New Mexico in the current year, 2013 in a reality close to our real-life one. There was a scene of me driving with Sophia in Albuquerque headed somewhere to meet with family. A scene Sanjam and others were in a cafeteria of sorts. I pointed out Steve & Stu were there down a few rows and a couple other people from NJ and said this would be a nice place for us all to take some time off. There was a dream of me playing a cheaper version of grand theft auto. It reminded me of my Die Hard game for Sega Saturn a little actually except with cars and I was duel wielding two shot guns at one point. 

<br><br>

In the final scene I was in Los Alamos, presumably at Gabe’s house although Gabe wasn’t there. It was his father Bill and some family friends that went without recognizable identities. I remember in the prior scene looking at a web design magazine and seeing all the cool apps people were coming out with. Now in this act Bill was looking at the same magazine and saying something along the lines of “Oh if I was young in this age”, implying that he would have loved to be young in this time and to be creative with app making and make money from it at the same time. This was all I remember from this dream-act.
